       "['Neuronal progenitors in the developing forebrain undergo dynamic competence states to ensure timely generation of specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes from distinct neurogenic niches of the dorsal and ventral forebrain, respectively. Here we show evidence of progenitor plasticity when Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is left unmodulated in the embryonic neocortex of the mammalian dorsal forebrain. We found that at early stages of corticogenesis, loss of Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), a potent inhibitor of SHH signaling, in neocortical progenitors, altered the transcriptomic landscape of male mouse embryos. Ectopic activation of SHH signaling occurred, via degradation of Gli3R, resulting in significant upregulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor 15 (',\n",
       " 'Functional connectivity studies have identified at least two large-scale neural systems that constitute cognitive control networks - the frontoparietal network (FPN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON). Control networks are thought to support goal-directed cognition and behavior. It was previously shown that the FPN flexibly shifts its global connectivity pattern according to task goal, consistent with a \"flexible hub\" mechanism for cognitive control. Our aim was to build on this finding to develop a functional cartography (a multi-metric profile) of control networks in terms of dynamic network properties. We quantified network properties in (male and female) humans using a high-control-demand cognitive paradigm involving switching among 64 task sets. We hypothesized that cognitive control is enacted by the FPN and CON via distinct but complementary roles reflected in network dynamics. Consistent with a flexible \"coordinator\" mechanism, FPN connections were varied across tasks, while maintaining within-network connectivity to aid cross-region coordination. Consistent with a flexible \"switcher\" mechanism, CON regions switched to other networks in a task-dependent manner, driven primarily by reduced within-network connections to other CON regions. This pattern of results suggests FPN acts as a dynamic, global coordinator of goal-relevant information, while CON transiently disbands to lend processing resources to other goal-relevant networks. This cartography of network dynamics reveals a dissociation between two prominent cognitive control networks, suggesting complementary mechanisms underlying goal-directed cognition.',\n",
       " 'Experimentalists studying multisensory integration compare neural responses to multisensory stimuli with responses to the component modalities presented in isolation. This procedure is problematic for multisensory speech perception since audiovisual speech and auditory-only speech are easily intelligible but visual-only speech is not. To overcome this confound, we developed intracranial encephalography (iEEG) deconvolution. Individual stimuli always contained both auditory and visual speech but jittering the onset asynchrony between modalities allowed for the time course of the unisensory responses and the interaction between them to be independently estimated. We applied this procedure to electrodes implanted in human epilepsy patients (both male and female) over the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), a brain area known to be important for speech perception. iEEG deconvolution revealed sustained positive responses to visual-only speech and larger, phasic responses to auditory-only speech. Confirming results from scalp EEG, responses to audiovisual speech were weaker than responses to auditory-only speech, demonstrating a subadditive multisensory neural computation. Leveraging the spatial resolution of iEEG, we extended these results to show that subadditivity is most pronounced in more posterior aspects of the pSTG. Across electrodes, subadditivity correlated with visual responsiveness, supporting a model in which visual speech enhances the efficiency of auditory speech processing in pSTG. The ability to separate neural processes may make iEEG deconvolution useful for studying a variety of complex cognitive and perceptual tasks.',\n",
       " 'Hedonic processing plays an integral role in directing appropriate behavior, but disrupted hedonic processing is associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression. The infralimbic cortex (IL) is a key structure in affective processing in rodents and activation of its human homologue, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, has been implicated in suppressing aversive states. Here, we tested whether optogenetic activation of glutamatergic projections from the IL to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) suppresses the aversive impact of sucrose devalued using the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm in males and female rats. In naïve rats, no significant differences in appetitive or aversive TR to sucrose was observed indicating that initial sucrose palatability was equivalent across sex. However, we found that optical activation of the IL-NAcSh pathway during intraoral infusion of devalued sucrose inhibited aversive taste reactivity (TR) in male but not female rats. Interestingly, when allowed to freely ingest water and sucrose in a 2-bottle test both males and females with a history of IL-NAcSh stimulation exhibited greater preference for sucrose. Optical pathway activation failed to alter TR to innately bitter quinine in either sex. Finally, both sexes lever pressed to self-stimulate the IL-NAcSh pathway. These results indicate that the IL-NAcSh pathway plays an important role in suppressing ',\n",
       " 'Decisions under threat are crucial to survival and require integration of distinct situational features such as threat probability and magnitude. Recent evidence from human lesion and neuroimaging studies implicated anterior hippocampus (aHC) and amygdala in approach/avoidance decisions under threat, and linked their integrity to cautious behavior. Here we sought to elucidate how threat dimensions and behavior are represented in these structures.Twenty human participants (11 female) completed an approach-avoidance conflict task during high-resolution functional MRI. Participants could gather tokens under threat of capture by a virtual predator, which would lead to token loss. Threat probability (predator wake-up rate) and magnitude (amount of token loss) varied on each trial. To disentangle effects of threat features, and ensuing behavior, we performed a multifold parametric analysis.We found that high threat probability and magnitude related to BOLD signal in left anterior hippocampus/entorhinal cortex. However BOLD signal in this region was better explained by avoidance behavior than by these threat features. A priori region-of-interest analysis confirmed the relation of anterior hippocampus BOLD response with avoidance. Exploratory subfield analysis revealed that this relation was specific to anterior CA2/3 but not CA1. Left lateral amygdala responded to low and high, but not intermediate threat probability.Our results suggest that anterior hippocampus BOLD signal is better explained by avoidance behavior than by threat features in approach-avoidance conflict. Rather than representing threat features in a monotonic manner, it appears that anterior hippocampus may compute approach/avoidance decisions based on integration of situational threat features represented in other neural structures.',\n",
       " \"Brain responses vary considerably from moment to moment, even to identical sensory stimuli. This has been attributed to changes in instantaneous neuronal states determining the system's excitability. Yet the spatio-temporal organization of these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we test whether variability in stimulus-evoked activity can be interpreted within the framework of criticality, which postulates dynamics of neural systems to be tuned towards the phase transition between stability and instability as is reflected in scale-free fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity. Using a novel non-invasive approach in 33 male human participants, we tracked instantaneous cortical excitability by inferring the magnitude of excitatory post-synaptic currents from the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential. Fluctuations of cortical excitability demonstrated long-range temporal dependencies decaying according to a power law across trials - a hallmark of systems at critical states. As these dynamics covaried with changes in pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), we establish a mechanistic link between ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability and argue that the co-emergence of common temporal power laws may indeed originate from neural networks poised close to a critical state. In contrast, no signatures of criticality were found in subcortical or peripheral nerve activity. Thus, criticality may represent a parsimonious organizing principle of variability in stimulus-related brain processes on a cortical level, possibly reflecting a delicate equilibrium between robustness and flexibility of neural responses to external stimuli.\",\n",
       " 'The axon initial segment (AIS) is involved in action potential initiation. Structural and biophysical characteristics of the AIS differ among cell types and/or brain regions, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Using immunofluorescence and electrophysiological methods, combined with super-resolution imaging, we show in the developing nucleus magnocellularis of the chicken of both sexes that the AIS is refined in a tonotopic-region-dependent manner. This process of AIS refinement differs among cells tuned to different frequencies. At hearing onset, the AIS was ∼50 µm long with few voltage-gated sodium channels irrespective of tonotopic region. However, after hatching, the AIS matured and displayed a ∼20-µm long structure with a significant enrichment of sodium channels responsible for an increase in sodium current and a decrease in spike threshold. Moreover, the shortening was more pronounced, while the accumulation of channels was not, in neurons tuned to higher frequency, creating tonotopic differences in the AIS. We conclude that AIS shortening is mediated by disassembly of the cytoskeleton at the distal end of the AIS, despite intact periodicity of the submembranous cytoskeleton across the AIS. Importantly, deprivation of afferent input diminished the shortening in neurons tuned to higher frequency to a larger extent in posthatch animals, with little effect on the accumulation of sodium channels. Thus, cytoskeletal reorganization and sodium channel enrichment at the AIS are differentially regulated depending on tonotopic region, but work synergistically to optimize neuronal output in the auditory nucleus.',\n",
       " 'Despite intense research the neural correlates of stroke-induced deficits of spatial cognition remain controversial. For example, several cortical regions and white-matter tracts have been designated as possible anatomical predictors of spatial neglect. However, many studies focused on local anatomy, an approach which does not harmonize with the notion that brain-behavior relationships are flexible and may involve interactions among distant regions. We studied in humans of either sex resting-state fMRI connectivity associated with performance in line bisection, reading and visual search, tasks commonly employed for the clinical diagnosis of neglect. We defined left and right frontal, parietal and temporal areas as seeds (or regions of interest; ROIs), and measured whole-brain seed-based functional connectivity (FC) and ROI-to-ROI connectivity in subacute right-hemisphere stroke patients. Performance on the line bisection task was associated with decreased FC between the right fusiform gyrus and left superior occipital cortex. Complementary increases and decreases of connectivity between both temporal and occipital lobes predicted reading errors. In addition, visual search deficits were associated with modifications of FC between left and right inferior parietal lobes and right insular cortex. These distinct connectivity patterns were substantiated by analyses of FC between left- and right-hemispheric ROIs, which revealed that decreased interhemispheric and right intrahemispheric FC was associated with higher levels of impairment. Together, these findings indicate that intrahemispheric and interhemispheric cooperation between brain regions lying outside the damaged area contribute to spatial deficits in a way that depends on the different cognitive components recruited during reading, spatial judgments and visual exploration.',\n",
       " 'Visuo-motor transformations at the cortical level occur along a network where posterior parietal regions are connected to homologous premotor regions. Grasping-related activity is represented in a diffuse, ventral and dorsal system in the posterior parietal regions, but no systematic causal description of a premotor counterpart of a similar diffuse grasping representation is available. To fill this gap, we measured the kinematics of right finger movements in 17 male and female human participants during grasping of 3 objects of different sizes. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) was applied 100 ms after visual presentation of the object over a regular grid of 8 spots covering the left premotor cortex (PMC) and 2 Sham stimulations. Maximum finger aperture during reach was used as the feature to classify object size in different types of classifiers. Classification accuracy was taken as a measure of the efficiency of visuo-motor transformations for grasping. Results showed that TMS reduced classification accuracy compared to Sham stimulation when it was applied to two spots in the ventral PMC and 1 spot in the medial PMC, corresponding approximately to the ventral premotor cortex and the dorsal portion of the supplementary motor area. Our results indicate a multifocal representation of object geometry for grasping in the PM that matches the known multifocal parietal maps of grasping representations. Additionally, we confirm that by applying a uniform spatial sampling procedure TMS can produce cortical functional maps independent of a priori spatial assumptions.',\n",

       " 'The most basic form of locomotion in limbed vertebrates consists of alternating activities of the flexor and extensor muscles within each limb coupled with left/right limb alternation. Although larval zebrafish are not limbed, their pectoral fin movements exhibit fundamental aspects of this basic movement: abductor/adductor alternation (corresponding to flexor/extensor alternation) and left/right fin alternation. Due to the simplicity of their movements and the compact neural organization of their spinal cords, zebrafish can serve as a good model to identify the neuronal networks of the central pattern generator (CPG) that controls rhythmic appendage movements. Here, we set out to investigate neuronal circuits underlying rhythmic pectoral fin movements in larval zebrafish, utilizing transgenic fish that specifically express GFP in abductor or adductor motor neurons (MNs) and candidate CPG neurons. First, we showed that spiking activities of abductor and adductor MNs were essentially alternating. Second, both abductor and adductor MNs received rhythmic excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs in their active and inactive phases, respectively, indicating that the MN spiking activities are controlled in a push-pull manner. Further, we obtained evidence that ',\n",
       " 'The ability to rapidly and accurately recognise complex objects is a crucial function of the human visual system. To recognise an object, we need to bind incoming visual features such as colour and form together into cohesive neural representations and integrate these with our pre-existing knowledge about the world. For some objects, typical colour is a central feature for recognition; for example, a banana is typically yellow. Here, we applied multivariate pattern analysis on time-resolved neuroimaging (magnetoencephalography) data to examine how object-colour knowledge affects emerging object representations over time. Our results from 20 participants (11 female) show that the typicality of object-colour combinations influences object representations, although not at the initial stages of object and colour processing. We find evidence that colour decoding peaks later for atypical object-colour combinations in comparison to typical object-colour combinations, illustrating the interplay between processing incoming object features and stored object-knowledge. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the integration of incoming visual information with existing conceptual object knowledge.',\n",
       " 'Primary motor cortex (M1) almost exclusively controls the contralateral side of the body. However, M1 activity is also modulated during ipsilateral body movements. Previous work has shown that M1 activity related to the ipsilateral arm is independent of the M1 activity related to the contralateral arm. How do these patterns of activity interact when both arms move simultaneously? We explored this problem by training two monkeys (male, Macaca mulatta) in a postural perturbation task while recording from M1. Loads were applied to one arm at a time (unimanual) or both arms simultaneously (bimanual). We found 83% of neurons (n=236) were responsive to both the unimanual and bimanual loads. We also observed a small reduction in activity magnitude during the bimanual loads for both limbs (25%). Across the unimanual and bimanual loads, neurons largely maintained their preferred load directions. However, there was a larger change in the preferred loads for the ipsilateral limb (∼25%) than the contralateral limb (∼9%). Lastly, we identified the contralateral and ipsilateral subspaces during the unimanual loads and found they captured a significant amount of the variance during the bimanual loads. However, the subspace captured more of the bimanual variance related to the contralateral limb (97%) than the ipsilateral limb (66%). Our results highlight that even during bimanual motor actions, M1 largely retains its representations of the contralateral and ipsilateral limbs.',\n",
       " \"Because of the delays inherent in neural transmission, the brain needs time to process incoming visual information. If these delays were not somehow compensated, we would consistently mislocalize moving objects behind their physical positions. Twenty-five years ago, Nijhawan used a perceptual illusion he called the flash-lag effect (FLE) to argue that the brain's visual system solves this computational challenge by extrapolating the position of moving objects (Nijhawan, 1994). Although motion extrapolation had been proposed a decade earlier (e.g., Finke et al., 1986), the proposal that it caused the FLE and functioned to compensate for computational delays was hotly debated in the years that followed, with several alternative interpretations put forth to explain the effect. Here, I argue, 25 years later, that evidence from behavioral, computational, and particularly recent functional neuroimaging studies converges to support the existence of motion extrapolation mechanisms in the visual system, as well as their causal involvement in the FLE. First, findings that were initially argued to challenge the motion extrapolation model of the FLE have since been explained, and those explanations have been tested and corroborated by more recent findings. Second, motion extrapolation explains the spatial shifts observed in several FLE conditions that cannot be explained by alternative (temporal) models of the FLE. Finally, neural mechanisms that actually perform motion extrapolation have been identified at multiple levels of the visual system, in multiple species, and with multiple different methods. I outline key questions that remain, and discuss possible directions for future research.\",\n",
       " 'Age-related hearing loss arises from irreversible damage in the inner ear, where sound is transduced into electrical signals. Prior human studies suggested that sensory-cell loss is rarely the cause; correspondingly, animal work has implicated the stria vascularis, the cellular \"battery\" driving the amplification of sound by hair cell \"motors\". Here, quantitative microscopic analysis of hair cells, auditory nerve fibers and strial tissues in 120 human inner ears obtained at autopsy, most of whom had recent audiograms in their medical records, shows that the degree of hearing loss is well predicted from the amount of hair cell loss and that inclusion of strial damage does not improve the prediction. Although many aging ears showed significant strial degeneration throughout the cochlea, our statistical models suggest that, by the time strial tissues are lost, hair cell death is so extensive that the loss of battery is no longer important to pure-tone thresholds and that audiogram slope is not diagnostic for strial degeneration. These data comprise the first quantitative survey of hair cell death in normal-aging human cochleas, and reveal unexpectedly severe hair cell loss in low-frequency cochlear regions, and dramatically greater loss in high-frequency regions than seen in any aging animal model. Comparison of normal-aging ears to an age-matched group with acoustic-overexposure history suggests that a lifetime of acoustic overexposure is to blame.',\n",
       " 'The brain is an inherently dynamic system, and much work has focused on the ability to modify neural activity through both local perturbations and changes in the function of global network ensembles. Network controllability is a recent concept in network neuroscience that purports to predict the influence of individual cortical sites on global network states and state changes, thereby creating a unifying account of local influences on global brain dynamics. While this notion is accepted in engineering science, it is subject to ongoing debates in neuroscience as empirical evidence linking network controllability to brain activity and human behavior remains scarce. Here, we present an integrated set of multimodal brain-behavior relationships derived from fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied during an individually calibrated working memory task performed by individuals of both sexes. The modes describing the structural network system dynamics showed direct relationships to brain activity associated with task difficulty, with difficult-to-reach modes contributing to functional brain states in the hard task condition. Modal controllability (MC, a measure quantifying the contribution of difficult-to-reach modes) at the stimulated site predicted both fMRI activations associated with increasing task difficulty, and rTMS benefits on task performance. Furthermore, fMRI explained 64% of the variance between MC and the working memory benefit associated with 5Hz online rTMS. These results therefore provide evidence towards the functional validity of network control theory, and outline a clear technique for integrating structural network topology and functional activity to predict the influence of stimulation on subsequent behavior.',\n",
       " \"Our perceptions result from the brain's ability to make inferences, or predictive models, of sensory information. Recently, it has been proposed that psychotic traits may be linked to impaired predictive processes. Here, we examine the brain dynamics underlying statistical learning and inference in stable and volatile environments, in a population of healthy human individuals (N=75; Male/Female=36/39) with a range of psychotic-like experiences. We measured prediction error responses to sound sequences with electroencephalography, gauged sensory inference explicitly by behaviourally recording sensory statistical learning errors, and used dynamic causal modelling to tap into the underlying neural circuitry. We discuss the findings that were robust to replication across the two experiments (N=31 and N=44 for the Discovery and the Validation datasets, respectively). First, we found that during stable conditions, participants demonstrated greater precision in their predictive model, reflected in a larger prediction error response to unexpected sounds, and decreased statistical learning errors. Moreover, individuals with attenuated prediction errors in stable conditions were found to make greater incorrect predictions about sensory information. Critically, we show that greater errors in statistical learning and inference are related to increased psychotic-like experiences. These findings link neurophysiology to behaviour during statistical learning and prediction formation, as well as providing further evidence for the idea of a continuum of psychosis in the healthy, non-clinical population.\",\n",

Reports that both antagonists and agonists of the µ opioid receptor may alleviate LID severity in primate models of PD and LID, together with the failure of non-specific antagonist to improve LID in pilot clinical trials in patients, raises doubt about the reliability of the available data on the opioid system in PD and LID.

       " 'Precise extrinsic afferent (visceral sensory) and efferent (sympathetic and parasympathetic) innervation of the gut is fundamental for gut-brain crosstalk. Owing to the limitation of intrinsic markers to distinctively visualize the three classes of extrinsic axons, which intimately associate within the gut mesentery, detailed information on the development of extrinsic gut-innervating axons remains relatively sparse. Here, we mapped extrinsic innervation of the gut and explored the relationships among various types of extrinsic axons during embryonic development in mice. Visualization with characterized intrinsic markers revealed that visceral sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic axons arise from different anatomical locations, project in close association via the gut mesentery, and form distinctive innervation patterns within the gut from embryonic day 10.5 to 16.5. Genetic ablation of visceral sensory trajectories results in the erratic extension of both sympathetic and parasympathetic axons, implicating that afferent axons provide an axonal scaffold to route efferent axons. Co-culture assay further confirmed the attractive effect of sensory axons on sympathetic axons. Taken together, our study provides key information regarding the development of extrinsic gut-innervating axons occurring through heterotypic axonal interactions and provides an anatomical basis to uncover neural circuit assembly in the gut-brain axis.',\n",

Human subjects (male and female) completed multiple blocks of a reinforcement learning task that contained a global hierarchical structure governing stimulus-response action mapping. First, behavioral and computational evidence showed that humans successfully discover and transfer the hierarchical rule structure embedded within the task. Next, analysis of fMRI BOLD data revealed activity across a frontal-parietal network that was specifically associated with the discovery of this embedded structure. Finally, activity throughout a cingulo-opercular network supported the transfer and implementation of this discovered structure. Together, these results reveal a division of labor in which dissociable neural systems support the learning and transfer of abstract control structures.',\n",
       " 'Chronic pain caused by spinal cord injury (SCI) is notoriously resistant to treatment, particularly by opioids. After SCI, dorsal root ganglion neurons show hyperactivity and chronic depolarization of resting membrane potential (RMP) that is maintained by cAMP signaling through PKA and EPAC. Importantly, SCI also reduces the negative regulation by Gαi of adenylyl cyclase and its production of cAMP, independent of alterations in G protein-coupled receptors and/or G proteins. Opioid reduction of pain depends upon coupling of opioid receptors to Gαi/o family members. Combining high-content imaging and cluster analysis, we show that in male rats SCI decreases opioid responsiveness in vitro within a specific subset of small-diameter nociceptors that bind isolectin B4. This SCI effect is mimicked in nociceptors from naïve animals by a modest 5 min depolarization of RMP (15 mM K',\n",
       " 'In the primary visual cortex (V1) of higher mammals, long-range horizontal connections (LHCs) are observed to develop, linking iso-orientation domains of cortical tuning. It is unknown how this feature-specific wiring of circuitry develops before eye opening. Here, we suggest that LHCs in V1 may originate from spatio-temporally structured feedforward activities generated from spontaneous retinal waves. Using model simulations based on the anatomy and observed activity patterns of the retina, we show that waves propagating in retinal mosaics can initialize the wiring of LHCs by co-activating neurons of similar tuning, whereas equivalent random activities cannot induce such organizations. Simulations showed that emerged LHCs can produce the patterned activities observed in V1, matching the topography of the underlying orientation map. The model can also reproduce feature-specific microcircuits in the salt-and-pepper organizations found in rodents. Our results imply that early peripheral activities contribute significantly to cortical development of functional circuits.',\n",
       " \"Human hearing adapts to background noise, as evidenced by the fact that listeners recognize more isolated words when words are presented later rather than earlier in noise. This adaptation is likely due to the leading noise shifting ('adapting') the dynamic range of auditory neurons, which can improve the neural encoding of speech spectral and temporal cues. Because neural dynamic range adaptation depends on stimulus level statistics, here we investigated the importance of 'statistical' adaptation for improving speech recognition in noisy backgrounds. We compared the recognition of noised-masked words in the presence and in the absence of adapting noise precursors whose level was either constant or was changing every 50 ms according to different statistical distributions. Adaptation was measured for 28 listeners (9 men) and was quantified as the recognition improvement in the precursor relative to the no-precursor condition. Adaptation was largest for constant-level precursors and did not occur for highly fluctuating precursors, even when the two types of precursors had the same mean level and both activated the medial olivocochlear reflex. Instantaneous amplitude compression of the highly fluctuating precursor produced as much adaptation as the constant-level precursor did without compression. Altogether, results suggest that noise adaptation in speech recognition is probably mediated by neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent sound level. Further, they suggest that auditory peripheral compression per se, rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex, could facilitate noise adaptation by reducing the level fluctuations in the noise.\",\n",
       " 'A corollary discharge (CD) is a copy of a neuronal command for movement sent to other brain regions to inform them of the impending movement. In monkeys, a circuit from superior colliculus (SC) through medial dorsal thalamus (MD) to frontal eye field (FEF) carries such a CD for saccadic eye movements. This circuit provides the clearest example of such internal monitoring reaching cerebral cortex. In this report we first investigated the functional organization of the critical MD relay by systematically recording neurons within a grid of penetrations. In two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we found that lateral MD neurons carrying CD signals discharged before saccades to ipsilateral as well as contralateral visual fields instead of just contralateral fields, often had activity over large movement fields, and had activity from both central and peripheral visual fields. Each of these characteristics has been found in FEF, but these findings indicate that these characteristics are already present in the thalamus. These characteristics show that the MD thalamic relay is not passive but instead assembles inputs from the SC before transmission to cortex. We next determined the exact location of the saccade-related CD neurons using the grid of penetrations. The neurons occupy an anterior-posterior band at the lateral edge of MD, and we established this band in stereotaxic coordinates to facilitate future study of CD neurons. These observations reveal both the organizational features of the internal CD signals within the thalamus, and the location of the thalamic relay for those signals.',\n",
       " 'The dendritic arbor of neurons constrains the pool of available synaptic partners and influences the electrical integration of synaptic currents. Despite these critical functions, our knowledge of the dendritic structure of cortical neurons during early postnatal development and how these dendritic structures are modified by visual experience is incomplete. Here, we present a large-scale dataset of 849 three-dimensional reconstructions of the basal arbor of pyramidal neurons collected across early postnatal development in visual cortex of mice of either sex. We found that the basal arbor grew substantially between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P30, undergoing a 45% increase in total length. However, the gross number of primary neurites and dendritic segments was largely determined by P7. Growth from P7 to P30 occurred primarily through extension of dendritic segments. Surprisingly, comparisons of dark-reared and typically-reared mice revealed that a net gain of only 15% arbor length could be attributed to visual experience; most growth was independent of experience. To examine molecular contributions, we characterized the role of the activity-regulated small GTPase Rem2 in both arbor development and the maintenance of established basal arbors. We showed that Rem2 is an experience-dependent negative regulator of dendritic segment number during the visual critical period. Acute deletion of Rem2 reduced directionality of dendritic arbors. The data presented here establishes a highly detailed, quantitative analysis of basal arbor development that we believe has high utility both in understanding circuit development as well as providing a framework for computationalists wishing to generate anatomically accurate neuronal models',\n",

Less well understood is how complex addiction-related behaviors emerge from activity patterns across these compartments. Here we show how different forms of relapse to alcohol-seeking in male rats are assembled from activity across the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens. First, we used chemogenetic approaches to show a causal role for ventral tegmental area (VTA) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in two forms of relapse to alcohol-seeking: renewal (context-induced reinstatement) and reacquisition. Then, using gCaMP fiber photometry of VTA TH neurons, we identified medial and lateral VTA TH neuron activity profiles during self-administration, renewal, and reacquisition. Next we used optogenetic inhibition of VTA TH neurons to show distinct causal roles for VTA subregions in distinct forms of relapse. We then used dLight fiber photometry to measure dopamine binding across the ventral striatum (medal accumbens shell, accumbens core, lateral accumbens shell) and showed complex and heterogeneous profiles of dopamine binding during self-administration and relapse. Finally, we used representational similarity analysis to identify mesolimbic dopamine signatures of self-administration, extinction, and relapse. Our results show that signatures of relapse can be identified from heterogeneous activity profiles across the mesolimbic dopamine system and that these signatures are unique for different forms of relapse.',\n",
       " \"In our natural environment the senses are continuously flooded with myriads of signals. To form a coherent representation of the world, the brain needs to integrate sensory signals arising from a common cause and segregate signals coming from separate causes. An unresolved question is how the brain solves this binding or causal inference problem and determines the causal structure of the sensory signals.In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study human observers (female and male) were presented with synchronous auditory and visual signals at same (i.e. common cause) or different locations (i.e. separate causes). On each trial observers decided whether signals come from common or separate sources (i.e. 'causal decisions'). To dissociate participants' causal inference from the spatial correspondence cues we adjusted the signals' audiovisual disparity individually for each participant to threshold accuracy.Multivariate fMRI pattern analysis revealed the lateral prefrontal cortex as the only region that encodes predominantly the outcome of observers' causal inference (i.e. common vs. separate causes). By contrast, the frontal eye field (FEF) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS0-4) form a circuitry that concurrently encodes spatial (auditory and visual stimulus locations), decisional (causal inference) and motor response dimensions.These results suggest that the lateral prefrontal cortex plays a key role in inferring and making explicit decisions about the causal structure that generates sensory signals in our environment. By contrast, informed by observers' inferred causal structure the FEF-IPS circuitry integrates auditory and visual spatial signals into representations that guide motor responses.\",\n",

Like other integration hubs, it contains repeated neurochemical motifs with distinct inputs: GABA-rich modules are innervated by somatosensory structures, while auditory inputs to the LCIC target the surrounding extramodular matrix. To investigate potential mechanisms of convergence between these input streams, we used laser photostimulation circuit mapping to interrogate local LCIC circuits in adult mice of both sexes and found that input patterns are highly dependent upon cell type (GABAergic/non-GABAergic) and location (module/matrix). At the circuit level, these inputs yield a directional flow of local information primarily from the matrix to the modules. Further, the two compartments were found to project to distinct targets in the midbrain and thalamus. These data show that while connectional modularity in the LCIC gives rise to segregated input-output channels, local circuits provide the architecture for integration between these two streams.',\n",

Mormyrid fishes generate stereotyped electric pulses (electric organ discharge [EOD]) for communication and active sensing. The EOD has diversified extensively, especially in duration, which varies across species from 0.1 to over 10 ms. In the electrosensory hindbrain, a corollary discharge that signals the timing of EOD production provides brief, precisely timed inhibition that effectively blocks responses to self-generated EODs. However, corollary discharge inhibition has only been studied in a few species, all with short duration EODs. Here, we asked how corollary discharge inhibition has coevolved with the diversification of EOD duration. We addressed this question by comparing 7 mormyrid species (both sexes) having varied EOD duration. For each individual fish, we measured EOD duration and then measured corollary discharge inhibition by recording evoked potentials from midbrain electrosensory nuclei. We found that delays in corollary discharge inhibition onset were strongly correlated with EOD duration as well as delay to the first peak of the EOD. In addition, we showed that electrosensory receptors respond to self-generated EODs with spikes occurring in a narrow time window immediately following the first peak of the EOD. Direct comparison of time courses between the EOD and corollary discharge inhibition revealed that the inhibition overlaps the first peak of the EOD. Our results suggest that internal delays have shifted the timing of corollary discharge inhibition to optimally block responses to self-generated signals.',\n",
       " 'Previous studies demonstrate that activation of pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) protects oligodendrocytes against inflammation in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Interestingly, data indicate that the cytoprotective effects of PERK activation on oligodendrocytes during EAE are not mediated by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), but are accompanied by activation of Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB). NF-κB plays a critical role in MS and EAE; however, the effects of NF-κB activation on oligodendrocytes in these diseases remain elusive. Herein, we generated a mouse model that allow for activation of NF-κB specifically in oligodendrocytes, and found that enhanced NF-κB activation in oligodendrocytes had a minimal effect on their viability and function under normal conditions (both male and female mice). Interestingly, we found that enhanced NF-κB activation in oligodendrocytes attenuated EAE disease severity and ameliorated EAE-induced oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and axon degeneration, without affecting inflammation (female mice). Moreover, we showed that the detrimental effects of PERK inactivation in oligodendrocytes in EAE were accompanied by impaired NF-κB activation in oligodendrocytes, and were completely rescued by enhanced NF-κB activation in oligodendrocytes (female mice). These findings suggest that NF-κB activation accounts for the cytoprotective effects of PERK activation on oligodendrocytes in MS and EAE.',\n",

There is far less known about microglia-vascular interactions, particularly under healthy steady-state conditions. Here, we use the male and female mouse cerebral cortex to show that a higher percentage of microglia associate with the vasculature during the first week of postnatal development compared to older ages and the timing of these associations are dependent on the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1). Similar developmental microglia-vascular associations were detected in the prenatal human brain. Using live imaging in mice, we found that juxtavascular microglia migrated when microglia are actively colonizing the cortex and became stationary by adulthood to occupy the same vascular space for nearly 2 months. Further, juxtavascular microglia at all ages associate with vascular areas void of astrocyte endfeet and the developmental shift in microglial migratory behavior along vessels corresponded to when astrocyte endfeet more fully ensheath vessels. Together, our data provide a comprehensive assessment of microglia-vascular interactions. They support a mechanism by which microglia use the vasculature to migrate within the developing brain parenchyma. This migration becomes restricted upon the arrival of astrocyte endfeet such that juxtavascular microglia become highly stationary and stable in the mature cortex.',\n",

Here we study such mechanisms in the forebrain nucleus HVC (proper name), a cortex-like sensorimotor area of songbirds, otherwise known for being essential for singing in zebra finches. To study the role of the HVC in calling interactions between male and female mates, we used wireless telemetric systems for simultaneous measurement of neuronal activity of male zebra finches and vocalizations of males and females that freely interact with each other. In a non-social context, male HVC neurons displayed stereotypic premotor activity in relation to active calling and showed auditory-evoked activity to hearing of played-back female calls. In a social context, HVC neurons displayed auditory-evoked activity to hearing of female calls only if that neuron showed activity preceding the upcoming female calls. We hypothesize that this activity preceding the auditory-evoked activity in the male HVC represents a neural correlate of behavioral anticipation, predictive activity that helps to coordinate vocal communication between social partners.',\n",

However, it is not known whether there is a causal relationship between these phenomena. We found that in adult male Wistar rats, silencing the medial septum during recall did not affect avoidance memory expression or maintenance but abolished hPAC and the amnesia caused by the intra-hippocampal administration of reconsolidation blockers, both of which were restored by concomitant theta burst stimulation of the fimbria-fornix pathway. Remarkably, artificial hPAC generated by fimbria-fornix stimulation during recall of a learned avoidance response naturally resistant to hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation made it susceptible to reactivation-dependent amnesia. Our results indicate that hPAC mediates the destabilization required for avoidance memory reconsolidation, and suggest that generation of artificial hPAC at recall overcomes the boundary conditions of this process.',\n",
       " 'Motor learning depends on synaptic plasticity between corticostriatal projections and striatal medium spiny neurons. Retrograde tracing from the dorsolateral striatum reveals that both layer II/III and layer V neurons in the motor cortex express Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a potential regulator of plasticity in corticostriatal projections in male and female mice. The number of these BDNF expressing cortical neurons and levels of BDNF protein are highest in juvenile mice when adult motor patterns are shaped, while BDNF levels in the adult are low. When mice are trained by physical exercise in the adult, BDNF expression in motor cortex is re-induced especially in layer II/III projection neurons. Reduced expression of cortical BDNF in 3-month-old mice results in impaired motor learning while space memory is preserved. These findings suggest that activity regulates BDNF expression differentially in layer II/III and V striatal afferents from motor cortex and that cortical BDNF is essential for motor learning.',\n",
       " \"Perception is a process of inference, integrating sensory inputs with prior expectations. However, little is known regarding the temporal dynamics of this integration. It has been proposed that expectation plays a role early in the perceptual process, biasing sensory processing. Alternatively, others suggest that expectations are integrated only at later, post-perceptual decision-making stages. The current study aimed to dissociate between these hypotheses. We exposed human participants (male and female) to auditory cues predicting the likely direction of upcoming moving dot patterns, while recording neural activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants' reports of the moving dot directions were biased towards the direction predicted by the cues. To investigate when expectations affected sensory representations, we used inverted encoding models to decode the direction represented in early sensory signals. Strikingly, the cues modulated the direction represented in the MEG signal as early as 150 ms after visual stimulus onset. While this may not reflect a modulation of the initial feedforward sweep, it does reveal a modulation of early sensory representations. Exploratory analyses showed that the neural modulation was related to perceptual expectation effects: participants with a stronger perceptual bias towards the predicted direction also revealed a stronger reflection of the predicted direction in the MEG signal. For participants with this perceptual bias, a correlation between decoded and perceived direction already emerged prior to visual stimulus onset, suggesting that the pre-stimulus state of the visual cortex influences sensory processing. Together, these results suggest that expectations play an integral role in the neural computations underlying perception.\",\n",

Indeed, combined TLR3/9 activation augmented the suppression of glioma growth in organotypic brain slices from male mice in a microglia-dependent fashion, and this synergistic suppression depended on interferon β release and phagocytic tumor clearance. Combined TLR3/9 stimulation also augmented several functional features of microglia such as the release of pro-inflammatory factors, motility and phagocytosis activity.

We determined that in the developing rodent cerebellar cortex (of both sexes), there is a transient window when the dominant brain cannabinoid receptor, CB1R, is expressed on afferent terminals instead of output neuron Purkinje cell synapses that dominate the adult cerebellum. Activation of these afferent CB1Rs suppresses synaptic transmission onto developing granule cells, and consequently also suppresses excitation of downstream neurons in the developing cortical network, including non-synaptic, migrating neurons. Application of a CB1R antagonist during afferent stimulation trains and depolarizing voltage steps caused a significant, sustained potentiation of synaptic amplitude. Our data demonstrate that transiently expressed afferent CB1Rs regulate afferent synaptic strength during synaptogenesis, which enables coordinated dampening of transcortical developmental signals.',\n",

We hypothesized that spontaneous activations within a given brain region have comparable functional and physiological properties to task-evoked activations.

The pupillary response peaks lagged behind insular activations by several hundreds of milliseconds. We then detected spontaneous activations, within the same neuronal populations of insular cortex, that emerged intermittently during a wakeful \"resting state\" and that had comparable electrophysiological properties (magnitude, duration, and spectral signature) to task-evoked activations. Critically, similar to task-evoked activations, spontaneous activations systematically preceded phasic pupil dilations with a strikingly similar temporal profile.

Action inhibition causes both suppression of muscle activity and the transient excitation of antagonist muscles, the latter being termed active breaking. We hypothesized that active breaking is present when stopping muscle relaxations. Stop signal experiments were used to compare the mechanisms of active breaking for muscle relaxations and contractions in male and female human participants. In experiments 1 and 2, go signals were presented that required participants to contract or relax their biceps or triceps muscle. Infrequent Stop signals occurred after fixed delays (0-500 ms), requiring that participants cancelled go commands. In experiment 3, participants increased (contract) or decreased (relax) an existing isometric finger abduction depending on the go signal, and cancelled these force changes whenever Stop signals occurred (dynamically adjusted delay). We found that muscle relaxations were stopped rapidly, met predictions of existing race models, and had Stop signal reaction times that correlated with those observed during the stopping of muscle contractions, suggesting shared control mechanisms. However, stopped relaxations were preceded by transient increases in electromyography (EMG), while stopped contractions were preceded by decreases in EMG, suggesting a later divergence of control. Muscle state-specific active breaking occurred simultaneously across muscles, consistent with a central origin. Our results indicate that the later stages of action inhibition involve separate excitatory and inhibitory pathways, which act automatically to cancel complex body movements.',\n",

TCs function in parallel with but differently from MCs and are further classified into multiple subpopulations based on their anatomical and functional heterogeneities. Here we combined optogenetics with electrophysiology to characterize the synaptic transmission from a subpopulation of TCs, which exclusively express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), to two groups of spatially segregated GABAergic interneurons - granule cells (GCs) and glomerular interneurons in mice of both sexes with four major findings. First, CCKergic TCs receive direct input from the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). This monosynaptic transmission exhibits high fidelity in response to repetitive OSN input. Second, CCKergic TCs drive GCs through two functionally distinct types of monosynaptic connections: (1) dendrodendritic synapses onto GC distal dendrites via their lateral dendrites in the superficial external plexiform layer; (2) axodendritic synapses onto GC proximal dendrites via their axon collaterals or terminals in the internal plexiform layer on both sides of each bulb. Third, CCKergic TCs monosynaptically excite two subpopulations of inhibitory glomerular interneurons via dendrodendritic synapses. Finally, sniff-like patterned activation of CCKergic TCs induces robust frequency-dependent depression of the dendrodendritic synapses but facilitation of the axodendritic synapses. These results demonstrated important roles of the CCKergic TCs in olfactory processing by orchestrating OB inhibitory activities.',\n",

Sniffing allows animals to make odor-guided decisions within ∼200 ms, but animals routinely engage in bouts of high-frequency sniffing spanning several seconds; the impact of such repeated odorant sampling on odor representations remains unclear. We investigated this question in the mouse olfactory bulb, where mitral and tufted cells (MTCs) form parallel output streams of odor information processing. To test the impact of repeated odorant sampling on MTC responses, we used two-photon imaging in anesthetized male and female mice to record activation of MTCs while precisely varying inhalation frequency. A combination of genetic targeting and viral expression of GCaMP6 reporters allowed us to access mitral (MC) and superficial tufted cell (sTC) subpopulations separately. We found that repeated odorant sampling differentially affected responses in MCs and sTCs, with MCs showing more diversity than sTCs over the same time period. Impacts of repeated sampling among MCs included both increases and decreases in excitation, as well as changes in response polarity. Response patterns across simultaneously-imaged MCs reformatted over time, with representations of different odorants becoming more distinct. Individual MCs responded differentially to changes in inhalation frequency, whereas sTC responses were more uniform over time and across frequency. Our novel results support the idea that MCs and TCs comprise functionally distinct pathways for odor information processing, and we suggest that the reformatting of MC odor representations by high-frequency sniffing may serve to enhance the discrimination of similar odors.',\n",

Neuroimaging studies have observed morphologic and functional changes during adolescence, and it is believed that these changes serve to improve the functions of circuits that underlie decision-making.

Here, we developed a reversal-learning protocol for the rapid assessment of adaptive choice behavior in dynamic environments in rats as young as postnatal day 30. A computational framework was used to elucidate the reinforcement-learning mechanisms that change in adolescence and into adulthood. Using a cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we provide the first evidence that value-based choice behavior in a reversal-learning task improves during adolescence in male and female Long-Evans rats and demonstrate that the increase in reversal performance is due to alterations in value updating for positive outcomes. Furthermore, we report that reversal-learning trajectories in adolescence reliably predicted reversal performance in adulthood.

Anandamide (AEA) content was downregulated after repeated seizures, and pharmacological enhancement of AEA signaling rescued seizure-induced anxiety by restoring the tonic control of the eCB signaling over glutamatergic transmission. Moreover, AEA signaling augmentation also rescued the seizure-induced alterations of fear memory by restoring the phasic control of eCB signaling over GABAergic activity and plasticity in the BLA. These results indicate that modulation of AEA signaling represents a potential and promising target for the treatment of comorbid emotional dysfunction associated with epilepsy.',\n",

Here, we measured changes in important central motor pathways during strength training in 2 female macaque monkeys. Animals were trained to pull a handle with one arm; weights could be added to increase load. On each day, motor-evoked potentials in upper limb muscles were first measured after stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1), corticospinal tract (CST), and reticulospinal tract (RST). Monkeys then completed 50 trials with weights progressively increased over 8-9 weeks (final weight ∼6 kg, close to the animal's body weight). Muscle responses to M1 and RST stimulation increased during strength training; there were no increases in CST responses. Changes persisted during a 2 week washout period without weights. After a further 3 months of strength training, an experiment under anesthesia mapped potential responses to CST and RST stimulation in the cervical enlargement of the spinal cord. We distinguished the early axonal volley and later spinal synaptic field potentials, and used the slope of the relationship between these at different stimulus intensities as a measure of spinal input-output gain. Spinal gain was increased on the trained compared with the untrained side of the cord within the intermediate zone and motor nuclei for RST, but not CST, stimulation. We conclude that neural adaptations to strength training involve adaptations in the RST, as well as intracortical circuits within M1.

It is generally assumed that by 2 months of age adult-born neurons are mature and equivalent to the broader neuronal population, raising questions of how they might contribute to hippocampal function in old age when neurogenesis has declined. However, few have examined adult-born neurons beyond the critical period or directly compared them to neurons born in infancy. Here, we used a retrovirus to visualize functionally relevant morphological features of 2- to 24-week-old adult-born neurons in male rats. From 2 to 7 weeks, neurons grew and attained a relatively mature phenotype. However, several features of 7-week-old neurons suggested a later wave of growth: these neurons had larger nuclei, thicker dendrites, and more dendritic filopodia than all other groups. Indeed, between 7 and 24 weeks, adult-born neurons gained additional dendritic branches, formed a second primary dendrite, acquired more mushroom spines, and had enlarged mossy fiber presynaptic terminals. Compared with neonatal-born neurons, old adult-born neurons had greater spine density, larger presynaptic terminals, and more putative efferent filopodial contacts onto inhibitory neurons. By integrating rates of cell birth and growth across the life span, we estimate that adult neurogenesis ultimately produces half of the cells and the majority of spines in the dentate gyrus. Critically, protracted development contributes to the plasticity of the hippocampus through to the end of life, even after cell production declines. Persistent differences from neonatal-born neurons may additionally endow adult-born neurons with unique functions even after they have matured.',\n",

In this regard, at the cortical level, oxytocin can modulate the GABAergic transmission; consequently, an interaction modulating nociception could exist between oxytocin and GABA at RAIC. Here, we tested in male Wistar rats the effect of oxytocin microinjection into RAIC during an inflammatory (by subcutaneous peripheral injection of formalin) nociceptive input.

Yet it remains necessary to determine the extent to which this understanding generalizes to more complex conditions. To examine this problem, we measured how populations of direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) from the retinas of male and female mice respond to a global motion stimulus with its direction and speed changing dynamically. We then examined the encoding and decoding of motion direction in both individual and populations of DSGCs. Individual cells integrated global motion over ∼200 ms, and responses were tuned to direction. However, responses were sparse and broadly tuned, which severely limited decoding performance from small DSGC populations. In contrast, larger populations compensated for response sparsity, enabling decoding with high temporal precision (<100 ms). At these timescales, correlated spiking was minimal and had little impact on decoding performance, unlike results obtained using simpler local motion stimuli decoded over longer timescales. We use these data to define different DSGC population decoding regimes that use or mitigate correlated spiking to achieve high-spatial versus high-temporal resolution.',\n",
       " 'The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) is significantly reduced in schizophrenia. Notably, a similar MMN reduction can be achieved with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. Both phenomena have been interpreted as reflecting an impairment of predictive coding or, more generally, the \"Bayesian brain\" notion that the brain continuously updates a hierarchical model to infer the causes of its sensory inputs. Specifically, neurobiological interpretations of predictive coding view perceptual inference as an NMDAR-dependent process of minimizing hierarchical precision-weighted prediction errors (PEs), and disturbances of this putative process play a key role in hierarchical Bayesian theories of schizophrenia. Here, we provide empirical evidence for this theory, demonstrating the existence of multiple, hierarchically related PEs in a \"roving MMN\" paradigm. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to single-trial EEG data from healthy human volunteers of either sex who received the NMDAR antagonist S-ketamine in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject fashion. Using an unrestricted analysis of the entire time-sensor space, our trial-by-trial analysis indicated that low-level PEs (about stimulus transitions) are expressed early (102-207 ms poststimulus), while high-level PEs (about transition probability) are reflected by later components (152-199 and 215-277 ms) of single-trial responses. Furthermore, we find that ketamine significantly diminished the expression of high-level PE responses, implying that NMDAR antagonism disrupts the inference on abstract statistical regularities. Our findings suggest that NMDAR dysfunction impairs hierarchical Bayesian inference about the world\\'s statistical structure. Beyond the relevance of this finding for schizophrenia, our results illustrate the potential of computational single-trial analyses for assessing potential pathophysiological mechanisms.',\n",

Here we extend this observation by examining the role of two other inhibitory synapse constituents, vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) and gephyrin, in the NAc of male mice that underwent chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). We first performed transcriptional profiling of vGAT and gephyrin in postmortem NAc samples from a cohort of healthy controls, medicated and non-medicated MDD patients. In parallel, we conducted whole-cell electrophysiology recordings in the NAc of stress susceptible and stress resilient male mice following 10 days of CSDS. Finally, we utilized immunohistochemistry to analyze protein levels of vGAT and gephyrin in the NAc of mice after CSDS. We found that decreased vGAT and gephyrin mRNA in the NAc of non-medicated MDD patients is paralleled by decreased inhibitory synapse markers and decreased frequency of mini inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the NAc of susceptible mice, indicating a reduction in the number of NAc inhibitory synapses that is correlated with depression-like behavior. Overall, these findings suggest a common state of reduced inhibitory tone in the NAc in depression and stress susceptibility.',\n",
       " 'Lateral inhibition is a fundamental feature of circuits that process sensory information. In the mammalian olfactory system, inhibitory interneurons called short axon cells (SACs) comprise the first network mediating lateral inhibition between glomeruli, the functional units of early olfactory coding and processing. The connectivity of this network and its impact on odor representations is not well understood. To explore this question, we constructed a computational model of the interglomerular inhibitory network using detailed characterizations of SAC morphologies taken from mouse olfactory bulb (OB). We then examined how this network transformed glomerular patterns of odorant-evoked sensory input (taken from previously-published datasets) as a function of the selectivity of interglomerular inhibition. We examined three connectivity schemes: selective (each glomerulus connects to few others with heterogeneous strength), nonselective (glomeruli connect to most others with heterogenous strength), or global (glomeruli connect to all others with equal strength). We found that both selective and nonselective interglomerular networks could mediate heterogeneous patterns of inhibition across glomeruli when driven by realistic sensory input patterns, but that global inhibitory networks were unable to produce input-output transformations that matched experimental data and were poor mediators of intensity-dependent gain control. We further found that networks whose interglomerular connectivities were tuned by sensory input profile decorrelated odor representations moreeffectively. These results suggest that, despite their multiglomerular innervation patterns, SACs are capable of mediating odorant-specific patterns of inhibition between glomeruli that could, theoretically, be tuned by experience or evolution to optimize discrimination of particular odorants.',\n",
       " 'Modifications in the sensitivity of neural elements allow the brain to adapt its functions to varying demands. Frequency-dependent short-term synaptic depression (STD) provides a dynamic gain-control mechanism enabling adaptation to different background conditions alongside enhanced sensitivity to input-driven changes in activity. In contrast, synapses displaying frequency-invariant transmission can faithfully transfer ongoing presynaptic rates enabling linear processing, deemed critical for many functions. However, rigid frequency-invariant transmission may lead to runaway dynamics and low sensitivity to changes in rate. Here, I investigated the Purkinje cell to deep cerebellar nuclei neuron synapses (PC_DCNs), which display frequency invariance, and yet, PCs maintain background activity at disparate rates, even at rest. Using protracted PC_DCN activation (120 s) to mimic background activity in cerebellar slices from mature mice of both sexes, I identified a previously unrecognized, frequency-dependent, slow STD (S-STD), adapting IPSC amplitudes in tens of seconds to minutes. However, after changes in activation rates, over a behavior-relevant second-long time window, S-STD enabled scaled linear encoding of PC rates in synaptic charge transfer and DCN spiking activity. Combined electrophysiology, optogenetics, and statistical analysis suggested that S-STD mechanism is input-specific, involving decreased ready-to-release quanta, and distinct from faster short-term plasticity (f-STP). Accordingly, an S-STD component with a scaling effect (i.e., activity-dependent release sites inactivation), extending a model explaining PC_DCN release on shorter timescales using balanced f-STP, reproduced the experimental results. Thus, these results elucidates a novel slow gain-control mechanism able to support linear transfer of behavior-driven/learned PC rates concurrently with background activity adaptation, and furthermore, provides an alternative pathway to refine PC output.',\n",
       " 'The M-current is a low voltage-activated potassium current generated by neuronal Kv7 channels. A prominent role of the M-current is to a create transient increase of neuronal excitability in response to neurotransmitters through the suppression of this current. Accordingly, M-current suppression is assumed to be involved in higher brain functions including learning and memory. However, there is little evidence supporting such a role to date. To address this gap, we examined behavioral tasks to assess learning and memory in homozygous Kv7.2 knock-in mice, Kv7.2(S559A), which show reduced M-current suppression while maintaining a normal basal M-current activity in neurons. We found that Kv7.2(S559A) mice had normal object location memory and contextual fear memory, but impaired long-term object recognition memory. Furthermore, short-term memory for object recognition was intact in Kv7.2(S559A) mice. The deficit in long-term object recognition memory was restored by the administration of a selective Kv7 channel inhibitor, XE991, when delivered during the memory consolidation phase. Lastly, c-Fos induction 2 h after training in Kv7.2(S559A) mice was normal in the hippocampus, which corresponds to intact object location memory, but was reduced in the perirhinal cortex, which corresponds to impaired long-term object recognition memory. Together, these results support the overall conclusion that M-current suppression is important for memory consolidation of specific types of memories.',\n",
       " 'Tinnitus is a sound heard by 15% of the general population in the absence of any external sound. Because external sounds can sometimes mask tinnitus, tinnitus is assumed to affect the perception of external sounds, leading to hypotheses such as \"tinnitus filling in the temporal gap\" in animal models and \"tinnitus inducing hearing difficulty\" in human subjects. Here we compared performance in temporal, spectral, intensive, masking and speech-in-noise perception tasks between 45 human listeners with chronic tinnitus (18 females and 27 males with a range of ages and degrees of hearing loss) and 27 young, normal-hearing listeners without tinnitus (11 females and 16 males). After controlling for age, hearing loss, and stimulus variables, we discovered that, contradictory to the widely held assumption, tinnitus does not interfere with the perception of external sounds in 32 of the 36 measures. We interpret the present result to reflect a bottom-up pathway for the external sound and a separate top-down pathway for tinnitus. We propose that these two perceptual pathways can be independently modulated by attention, which leads to the asymmetrical interaction between external and internal sounds, and several other puzzling tinnitus phenomena such as discrepancy in loudness between tinnitus rating and matching. The present results suggest not only a need for new theories involving attention and central noise in animal tinnitus models but also a shift in focus from treating tinnitus to managing its comorbid conditions when addressing complaints about hearing difficulty in individuals with tinnitus.',\n",
       " 'The paranodal junctions flank mature nodes of Ranvier and provide a barrier between ion channels at the nodes and juxtaparanodes. These junctions also promote node assembly and maintenance by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we examine their role in the accumulation of NF186, a key adhesion molecule of PNS and CNS nodes. We previously showed that NF186 is initially targeted/accumulates via its ectodomain to forming PNS (hemi)nodes by diffusion trapping, whereas it is later targeted to mature nodes by a transport-dependent mechanism mediated by its cytoplasmic segment. To address the role of the paranodes in this switch, we compared accumulation of NF186 ectodomain and cytoplasmic domain constructs in WT versus paranode defective (i.e., Caspr-null) mice. Both pathways are affected in the paranodal mutants. In the PNS of Caspr-null mice, diffusion trapping mediated by the NF186 ectodomain aberrantly persists into adulthood, whereas the cytoplasmic domain/transport-dependent targeting is impaired. In contrast, accumulation of NF186 at CNS nodes does not undergo a switch; it is predominantly targeted to both forming and mature CNS nodes via its cytoplasmic domain and requires intact paranodes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis indicates that the paranodes provide a membrane diffusion barrier that normally precludes diffusion of NF186 to nodes. Linkage of paranodal proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton likely contributes to this diffusion barrier based on 4.1B and βII spectrin expression in Caspr-null mice. Together, these results implicate the paranodes as membrane diffusion barriers that regulate targeting to nodes and highlight differences in the assembly of PNS and CNS nodes.',\n",
       " \"Older persons and, more severely, persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit gait dysfunction, postural instability and a propensity for falls. These dopamine (DA) replacement-resistant symptoms are associated with losses of basal forebrain and striatal cholinergic neurons, suggesting that falls reflect disruption of the corticostriatal transfer of movement-related cues and their striatal integration with movement sequencing. To advance a rodent model of the complex movement deficits of Parkinsonian fallers, here we first demonstrated that male and female rats with dual cortical cholinergic and striatal DA losses (DL rats) exhibit cued turning deficits, modeling the turning deficits seen in these patients. As striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) are positioned to integrate movement cues with gait, and as ChI loss has been associated with falls in PD, we next used this task, as well as a previously established task used to reveal heightened fall rates in DL rats, to broadly test the role of ChIs. Chemogenetic inhibition of ChIs in otherwise intact male and female rats caused cued turning deficits and elevated fall rates. Spontaneous turning was unaffected. Furthermore, chemogenetic stimulation of ChIs in DL rats reduced fall rates and restored cued turning performance. Stimulation of ChIs was relatively more effective in rats with viral transfection spaces situated lateral to the DA depletion areas in the dorsomedial striatum. These results indicate that striatal ChIs are essential for the control of complex movements, and they suggest a therapeutic potential of stimulation of ChIs to restore gait and balance, and to prevent falls in PD.\",\n",

       " 'The slow waves of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflect experience-dependent plasticity and play a direct role in the restorative functions of sleep. Importantly, slow waves behave as traveling waves, and their propagation is assumed to occur through cortico-cortical white matter connections. In this light, the corpus callosum (CC) may represent the main responsible for cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation. To verify this hypothesis, we performed overnight high-density (hd)-EEG recordings in five patients who underwent total callosotomy due to drug-resistant epilepsy (CPs; two females), in three noncallosotomized neurologic patients (NPs; two females), and in a sample of 24 healthy adult subjects (HSs; 13 females). In all CPs slow waves displayed a significantly reduced probability of cross-hemispheric propagation and a stronger inter-hemispheric asymmetry. In both CPs and HSs, the incidence of large slow waves within individual NREM epochs tended to differ across hemispheres, with a relative overall predominance of the right over the left hemisphere. The absolute magnitude of this asymmetry was greater in CPs relative to HSs. However, the CC resection had no significant effects on the distribution of slow-wave origin probability across hemispheres. The present results indicate that CC integrity is essential for the cross-hemispheric traveling of slow waves in human sleep, which is in line with the assumption of a direct relationship between white matter integrity and slow-wave propagation. Our findings also revealed a residual cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation that may rely on alternative pathways, including cortico-subcortico-cortical loops. Finally, these data indicate that the lack of the CC does not lead to differences in slow-wave generation across brain hemispheres.',\n",

In young male FBN rats, we detail the following: (1) the distribution/expression of nAChR subunit transcripts in excitatory (VGluT1) and inhibitory (VGAT) neurons across A1 layers; (2) heteromeric nAChR binding across A1 layers; and (3) nAChR excitability in A1 layer (L) 5 cells. In aged rats, we detailed the impact of aging on A1 nAChR subunit expression across layers, heteromeric nAChR receptor binding, and nAChR excitability of A1 L5 cells. A majority of A1 cells coexpressed transcripts for β2 and α4 with or without α7, while dispersed subpopulations expressed β2 and α7 or α7 alone. nAChR subunit transcripts were expressed in young excitatory and inhibitory neurons across L2-L6. Transcript abundance varied across layers, and was highest for β2 and α4.

The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of systemic injections of the CB1r agonist (CP55940) on the balanced activity of the direct/indirect pathways in the SNr and its associated behaviors. To this aim, we recorded somatosensory and pathway-specific representations in the spiking activity of the SNr of male rats under CP55940. CB1r activation mainly decreased the inhibitory, potentially direct pathway component while sparing the excitatory, potentially indirect pathway component of somatosensory responses.

This improvement occurs independent of the motion direction used for training. We demonstrated that this enhanced ability to encode motion direction is mainly attributed to increased response reliability of ooDSGCs.

Various neuropeptides play important roles in the regulation of feeding behavior, including relaxin-3 (RLN3), which stimulates food intake in rats through the activation of the relaxin-family peptide-3 receptor (RXFP3). Here we demonstrate that a likely mechanism underlying the orexigenic action of RLN3 is RXFP3-mediated inhibition of oxytocin- and arginine-vasopressin-synthesizing paraventricular nucleus (PVN) magnocellular neurosecretory cells. Moreover, we reveal that, in male and female rats, this action depends on M-like potassium conductance. Notably, higher intra- and peri-PVN RLN3 fiber densities were observed in females, which may constitute an anatomic substrate for observed sex differences in binge-eating disorder. Finally, in a model of binge-eating in female rats, RXFP3 blockade within the PVN prevented binge-eating behavior. These data demonstrate a direct RLN3/RXFP3 action in the PVN of male and female rats, identify the associated ionic mechanisms, and reveal that hypothalamic RLN3/RXFP3 signaling regulates binge-eating behavior.',\n",

Previous research showed that natural variability in visual features across categories, quantified by image gist statistics, is highly correlated with the different neural responses observed in the occipitotemporal cortex. Using fMRI, we examined whether category selectivity for animals and tools would remain, when image gist statistics were comparable across categories. Critically, we investigated how category, shape, and spatial frequency may contribute to the category selectivity in the animal- and tool-selective regions. Female and male human observers viewed low- or high-passed images of round or elongated animals and tools that shared comparable gist statistics in the main experiment, and animal and tool images of naturally varied gist statistics in a separate localizer. Univariate analysis revealed robust category-selective responses for images with comparable gist statistics across categories. Successful classification for category (animals/tools), shape (round/elongated), and spatial frequency (low/high) was also observed, with highest classification accuracy for category. Representational similarity analyses further revealed that the activation patterns in the animal-selective regions were most correlated with a model that represents only animal information, whereas the activation patterns in the tool-selective regions were most correlated with a model that represents only tool information, suggesting that these regions selectively represent information of only animals or tools.

In the current study, we determined whether a seizure can activate nociceptive pathways that carry pain signals from the meninges to the spinal cord, and if so, to what extent and through which classes of peripheral and central neurons. To achieve these goals, we used single-unit recording techniques and an established animal model of seizure (picrotoxin) to determine the effects of epileptic seizure on the activity of trigeminovascular Aδ-, C-, wide-dynamic range, and high-threshold neurons in male and female rats. Occurrence of seizure activated 54%, 50%, 68%, and 39% of the Aδ-, C-, wide-dynamic range, and high-threshold neurons, respectively. Regardless of their class, activated neurons exhibited a twofold to fourfold increase in their firing, which started immediately (1 min) or up to 90 min after seizure initiation, and lasted as short as 10 min or as long as 120 min. Administration of lidocaine to the dura prevented activation of all neuronal classes but not the initiation or maintenance of the seizure. These findings suggest that all neuronal classes may be involved in the initiation and maintenance of seizure-induced headache, and that their activation patterns can provide a neural substrate for explaining the timing and duration of ictal and possibly postictal headaches. By using seizure, which is evident in humans, this study bypasses controversies associated with cortical spreading depression, which is less readily observed in humans.',\n",

Although RS-FC-based metrics can detect these changes, results from RS functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies are unclear and difficult to interpret, and the underlying dynamical mechanisms are still largely unknown. To better capture the RS dynamics, we phenomenologically extended the neural mass model of partial seizures, the Epileptor, by including two neuron subpopulations of epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic type, making it capable of producing physiological oscillations in addition to the epileptiform activity. Using the neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain, we reconstructed 14 epileptic and 5 healthy human (of either sex) brain network models (BNMs), based on individual anatomical connectivity and clinically defined epileptogenic heatmaps. Through systematic parameter exploration and fitting to neuroimaging data, we demonstrated that epileptic brains during interictal RS are associated with lower global excitability induced by a shift in the working point of the model, indicating that epileptic brains operate closer to a stable equilibrium point than healthy brains. Moreover, we showed that functional networks are unaffected by interictal spikes, corroborating previous experimental findings; additionally, we observed higher excitability in epileptogenic regions, in agreement with the data. We shed light on new dynamical mechanisms responsible for altered RS-FC in epilepsy, involving the following two key factors: (1) a shift of excitability of the whole brain leading to increased stability; and (2) a locally increased excitability in the epileptogenic regions supporting the mixture of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity in these areas.',\n",
       " 'Apparent motion (AM) is induced when two stationary visual stimuli are presented in alternating sequence. Intriguingly, AM leads to an impaired detectability of stimuli along the AM path (i.e., AM-induced masking). It has been hypothesized that AM triggers an internal representation of a moving object in early visual cortex, which competes with stimulus-evoked representations of visual stimuli on the motion path in early visual cortex of 25 human adults (16 female). We tested this hypothesis by measuring BOLD responses in early visual cortex during the process of AM-induced masking, using fMRI and population receptive field methods. Surprisingly, and counter to our hypothesis, we showed that AM suppressed, rather than increased, BOLD responses along early visual (V1 and V2) representations of the AM path, including regions that were not directly activated by the AM inducer stimuli. This activity suppression of the visual response predicted the subsequent reduction in detectability of the target that appeared in the middle of the AM path. Our data thereby provide direct empirical evidence for suppressive neural mechanisms underlying AM and suggest that illusory motion can render us blind to objects on the motion path by suppressing neural activity at the earliest cortical stages of visual perception.',\n",

One major distinction among objects is between those that are animate versus those that are inanimate. In addition, many objects are specified by more than a single sense, yet the nature by which multisensory objects are represented by the brain remains poorly understood. Using representational similarity analysis of male and female human EEG signals, we show enhanced encoding of audiovisual objects when compared with their corresponding visual and auditory objects. Surprisingly, we discovered that the often-found processing advantages for animate objects were not evident under multisensory conditions. This was due to a greater neural enhancement of inanimate objects-which are more weakly encoded under unisensory conditions. Further analysis showed that the selective enhancement of inanimate audiovisual objects corresponded with an increase in shared representations across brain areas, suggesting that the enhancement was mediated by multisensory integration. Moreover, a distance-to-bound analysis provided critical links between neural findings and behavior. Improvements in neural decoding at the individual exemplar level for audiovisual inanimate objects predicted reaction time differences between multisensory and unisensory presentations during a Go/No-Go animate categorization task. Links between neural activity and behavioral measures were most evident at intervals of 100-200 ms and 350-500 ms after stimulus presentation, corresponding to time periods associated with sensory evidence accumulation and decision-making, respectively.

In this study we tested the role of the MD in timing, using an operant temporal production task in male mice. In this task, the expected timing of available rewards is indicated by lever pressing. Inactivation of the MD with muscimol produced rightward shifts in peak pressing on probe trials as well as increases in peak spread, thus significantly altering both temporal accuracy and precision. Optogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic projection neurons in the MD also resulted in similar changes in timing. The observed effects were found to be independent of significant changes in movement.

In songbirds, the syrinx transforms song system motor commands into sound, and exhibits changes during song learning. Here we test the hypothesis that the transformation from motor commands to force trajectories by syringeal muscles functionally changes over vocal development in zebra finches. Our data collected in both sexes show that only in males, muscle speed significantly increases and that supralinear summation occurs and increases with muscle contraction speed. Furthermore, we show that previously reported sub-millisecond spike timing in the avian cortex can be resolved by superfast syringeal muscles and that the sensitivity to spike timing increases with speed. Because motor neuron and muscle properties are tightly linked, we make predictions on the boundaries of the yet unknown motor code that correspond well with cortical activity. Taken together, we show that syringeal muscles undergo essential transformations during song learning that drastically change how neural commands are translated into force profiles and thereby acoustic features. We propose that the song system motor code must compensate for these changes to achieve its acoustic targets. Our data thus supports the hypothesis that the neuromuscular transformation changes over vocal development and emphasizes the need for an embodied view of song motor learning.',\n",

E2 alters the activity of the dopamine system, including the VTA and its projection targets, which plays an important role in binge drinking. A previous study demonstrated that, during high E2 states, VTA neurons in female mice are more sensitive to ethanol excitation. However, the mechanisms responsible for the ability of E2 to enhance ethanol sensitivity of VTA neurons have not been investigated. In this study, we used selective agonists and antagonists to examine the role of ER subtypes (ERα and ERβ) in regulating the ethanol sensitivity of VTA neurons in female mice and found that ERα promotes the enhanced ethanol response of VTA neurons. We also demonstrated that enhancement of ethanol excitation requires the activity of the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR1, which is known to couple with ERα at the plasma membrane. To investigate the behavioral relevance of these findings, we administered lentivirus-expressing short hairpin RNAs targeting either ERα or ERβ into the VTA and found that knockdown of each receptor in the VTA reduced binge-like ethanol drinking in female, but not male, mice. Reducing ERα in the VTA had a more dramatic effect on binge-like drinking than reducing ERβ, consistent with the ability of ERα to alter ethanol sensitivity of VTA neurons.

Human participants of both sexes searched arrays for targets of either a high-physical-salience color or one of two low-physical-salience colors across three experimental phases. The first phase (\"baseline\") offered no rewards. RT and N2pc latencies were shorter for high-physical-salience targets, indicating faster attentional orienting. In the second phase (\"equal-reward\"), a low monetary reward was given for fast correct responses for all target types. This reward context improved overall performance, similarly shortening RTs and enhancing N2pc amplitudes for all target types, but with no change in N2pc latencies. In the third phase (\"selective-reward\"), the reward rate was made selectively higher for one of the two low-physical-salience colors, resulting in their RTs becoming as fast as the high-physical-salience targets. Despite the equally fast RTs, the N2pc\\'s for these low-physical-salience, high-value targets remained later than for high-physical-salience targets, instead eliciting significantly larger N2pc\\'s.

       " 'The limitation of plasticity in the adult brain impedes functional recovery later in life from brain injury or disease. This pressing clinical issue may be resolved by enhancing plasticity in the adult brain. One strategy for triggering robust plasticity in adulthood is to reproduce one of the hallmark physiological events of experience-dependent plasticity observed during the juvenile critical period: to rapidly reduce the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons and disinhibit local excitatory neurons. This may be achieved through the enhancement of local inhibitory inputs, particularly those of somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons. However, to date the means for manipulating SST interneurons for enhancing cortical plasticity in the adult brain are not known. We show that SST interneuron-selective overexpression of Lypd6, an endogenous nicotinic signaling modulator, enhances ocular dominance plasticity in the adult primary visual cortex (V1). Lypd6 overexpression mediates a rapid experience-dependent increase in the visually evoked activity of SST interneurons as well as a simultaneous reduction in PV interneuron activity and disinhibition of excitatory neurons. Recapitulating this transient activation of SST interneurons using chemogenetics similarly enhanced V1 plasticity. Notably, we show that SST-selective Lypd6 overexpression restores visual acuity in amblyopic mice that underwent early long-term monocular deprivation.

We found that all nine models together contributed 78% of the variance of human scene similarity assessments and were within the noise ceiling of the vERP data. Low-level models explained earlier vERP variability (88 ms after image onset), whereas high-level models explained later variance (169 ms).

       " 'Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons play a key role in the maturation and synchronization of cortical circuitry and alterations in these inhibitory neurons, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), have been found in different psychiatric disorders. The formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) around many of these interneurons at the end of the critical periods reduces their plasticity and sets their connectivity. Consequently, the presence of PNNs must have an important impact on the synaptic input and the physiology of PV+ cells. In the present study, we have found that in adult male mice, prefrontocortical PV+ cells surrounded by PNNs show higher density of perisomatic excitatory and inhibitory puncta, longer axonal initial segments (AISs), and higher PV expression when compared with PV+ cells lacking PNNs. In order to better understand the impact of PNNs on the connectivity and physiology of PV+ interneurons in the mPFC, we have digested enzymatically these structures and have found a decrease in the density of inhibitory puncta on their perisomatic region but not on the PV+ perisomatic puncta on pyramidal neurons. Moreover, extracellular recordings show that the digestion of PNNs induces a decrease in γ activity, an oscillation dependent on PV+ cells, in the mPFC of anesthetized mice. Our results suggest that the presence of PNNs enwrapping PV+ cells regulates their inhibitory input and has a potent influence on their activity. These results may be relevant for psychiatric research, given the alterations in PNNs, PV+ interneurons and their physiology described in different mental disorders.',\n",
       " \"The mesolimbic dopaminergic system exerts a crucial influence on incentive processing. However, the contribution of dopamine in dynamic, ecological situations where reward rates vary, and decisions evolve over time, remains unclear. In such circumstances, current (foreground) reward accrual needs to be compared continuously with potential rewards that could be obtained by traveling elsewhere (background reward rate), to determine the opportunity cost of staying versus leaving. We hypothesized that dopamine specifically modulates the influence of background, but not foreground, reward information when making a dynamic comparison of these variables for optimal behavior. On a novel foraging task based on an ecological account of animal behavior (marginal value theorem), human participants of either sex decided when to leave locations in situations where foreground rewards depleted at different rates, either in rich or poor environments with high or low background reward rates. In line with theoretical accounts, people's decisions to move from current locations were independently modulated by changes in both foreground and background reward rates. Pharmacological manipulation of dopamine D2 receptor activity using the agonist cabergoline significantly affected decisions to move on, specifically modulating the effect of background reward rates. In particular, when on cabergoline, people left patches in poor environments much earlier. These results demonstrate a role of dopamine in signaling the opportunity cost of rewards, not value per se. Using this ecologically derived framework, we uncover a specific mechanism by which D2 dopamine receptor activity modulates decision-making when foreground and background reward rates are dynamically compared.\",\n",

The amygdala is involved in hedonic valuation, but its role in valence assignment during food choices is less understood. Given recent evidence for spatially segregated amygdala signatures encoding palatability, we applied a multivariate approach on fMRI data to extract valence-specific signal patterns during an explicit evaluation of food liking. These valence localizers were then used to identify hedonic valuation processes while the same healthy human participants (14 female, 16 male; in overnight fasted state on both scanning days) performed a willingness-to-eat task in a separate fMRI measurement. Valence-specific patterns of amygdala signaling predicted decisions on food consumption significantly. Findings could be validated using the same valence localizers to predict consumption decisions participants made on a separate set of food stimuli that had not been used for localizer identification. Control analyses revealed these findings to be restricted to a multivariate compared with a univariate approach, and to be specific for valence processing in the amygdala. Spatially distributed valuation signals of the amygdala thus appear to modulate appetitive consumption decisions, and may be useful to identify current hedonic valuation processes triggering food choices even when not explicitly instructed.',\n",

It is commonly assumed that this ability relies on the robustness of auditory cortex responses. However, only a few attempts have been made to characterize neural discrimination of communication sounds masked by noise at each stage of the auditory system and to quantify the noise effects on the neuronal discrimination in terms of alterations in amplitude modulations. Here, we measured neural discrimination between communication sounds masked by a vocalization-shaped stationary noise from multiunit responses recorded in the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, auditory thalamus, and primary and secondary auditory cortex at several signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in anesthetized male or female guinea pigs. Masking noise decreased sound discrimination of neuronal populations in each auditory structure, but collicular and thalamic populations showed better performance than cortical populations at each SNR. In contrast, in each auditory structure, discrimination by neuronal populations was slightly decreased when tone-vocoded vocalizations were tested. These results shed new light on the specific contributions of subcortical structures to robust sound encoding, and suggest that the distortion of slow amplitude modulation cues conveyed by communication sounds is one of the factors constraining the neuronal discrimination in subcortical and cortical levels.',\n",
       " \"Alterations of excitatory synaptic function are the strongest correlate to the pathologic disturbance of cognitive ability observed in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This pathologic feature is driven by amyloid-β oligomers (Aβos) and propagates from neuron to neuron. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which Aβos affect the function of synapses and how these alterations propagate to surrounding healthy neurons. We used complementary techniques ranging from electrophysiological recordings and molecular biology to confocal microscopy in primary cortical cultures, and from acute hippocampal and cortical slices from male wild-type and amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-out (KO) mice to assess the effects of Aβos on glutamatergic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and dendritic spine structure. We showed that extracellular application of Aβos reduced glutamatergic synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation. These alterations were not observed in APP KO neurons, suggesting that APP expression is required. We demonstrated that Aβos/APP interaction increases the amyloidogenic processing of APP leading to intracellular accumulation of newly produced Aβos. Intracellular Aβos participate in synaptic dysfunctions as shown by pharmacological inhibition of APP processing or by intraneuronal infusion of an antibody raised against Aβos. Furthermore, we provide evidence that following APP processing, extracellular release of Aβos mediates the propagation of the synaptic pathology characterized by a decreased spine density of neighboring healthy neurons in an APP-dependent manner. Together, our data unveil a complementary role for Aβos in AD, while intracellular Aβos alter synaptic function, extracellular Aβos promote a vicious cycle that propagates synaptic pathology from diseased to healthy neurons.\",\n",

This raises the possibility of applying a specific environmental stimulus to induce a switch that can enhance a desirable behavior or ameliorate symptoms of a specific pathology. For example, a stimulus inducing an increase in the number of neurons expressing dopamine could treat Parkinson's disease, or one affecting the number expressing serotonin could alleviate depression. This may already be producing successful treatment outcomes without our knowing that transmitter switching is involved, with improvement of motor function through physical activity and cure of seasonal depression with phototherapy.

       " 'Understanding how disruption of prefrontal cortex (PFC) maturation during adolescence is crucial to reveal which neural processes could contribute to the onset of psychiatric disorders that display frontal cortical deficits. Of particular interest is the gain of GABAergic function in the PFC during adolescence and its susceptibility to the impact of transient blockade of NMDA receptor function. Here we assessed whether exposure to MK-801 during adolescence in male rats triggers a state of excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the PFC that limits its functional capacity to regulate behavior in adulthood. Recordings from PFC brain slices revealed that MK-801 exposure during adolescence preferentially reduces the presynaptic functionality of GABAergic activity over that of excitatory synapses. As a result, an imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory synaptic activity emerges in the PFC that correlates linearly with the GABAergic deficit. Notably, the data also suggest that the diminished prefrontal GABAergic function could arise from a deficit in the recruitment of fast-spiking interneurons by excitatory inputs during adolescence. At the behavioral level, MK-801 exposure during adolescence did not disrupt the acquisition of trace fear conditioning, but markedly increased the level of freezing response during extinction testing.

Previous research has suggested that neuronal oscillations at different frequency bands are associated with top-down cognitive control; however, whether distinct neural oscillations have similar or different functions for cognitive control is not well understood. The aim of the current study was to investigate the oscillatory neuronal mechanisms underlying two distinct components of hierarchical cognitive control: the level of abstraction of a rule, and the number of rules that must be maintained (set-size). We collected EEG data in 31 men and women who performed a hierarchical cognitive control task that varied in levels of abstraction and set-size. Results from time-frequency analysis in frontal electrodes showed an increase in theta amplitude for increased set-size, whereas an increase in δ was associated with increased abstraction. Both theta and δ amplitude correlated with behavioral performance in the tasks but in an opposite manner: theta correlated with response time slowing when the number of rules increased, whereas δ correlated with response time when rules became more abstract. Phase-amplitude coupling analysis revealed that δ phase-coupled with β amplitude during conditions with a higher level of abstraction, whereby beta band may potentially represent motor output that was guided by the δ phase. These results suggest that distinct neural oscillatory mechanisms underlie different components of hierarchical cognitive control.',\n",

In Parkinson's disease (PD), γ oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network is altered and the LTP-like plasticity elicited by intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is reduced in the primary motor cortex (M1). In this study, we tested whether transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) delivered at γ frequency promotes iTBS-induced LTP-like plasticity in M1 in PD patients. Sixteen patients (OFF condition) and 16 healthy subjects (HSs) underwent iTBS during γ-tACS (iTBS-γ tACS) and during sham-tACS (iTBS-sham tACS) in two sessions. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) were recorded before and after the costimulation. A subgroup of patients also underwent iTBS during β tACS. iTBS-sham tACS facilitated single-pulse MEPs in HSs, but not in patients. iTBS-γ tACS induced a larger MEP facilitation than iTBS-sham tACS in both groups, with similar values in patients and HSs. In patients, SICI improved after iTBS-γ tACS. The effect produced by iTBS-γ tACS on single-pulse MEPs correlated with disease duration, while changes in SICI correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores. The effect of iTBS-β tACS on both single-pulse MEPs and SICI was similar to that obtained in the iTBS-sham tACS session. Our data suggest that γ oscillations have a role in the pathophysiology of the abnormal LTP-like plasticity in PD. Entraining M1 neurons at the γ rhythm through tACS may be an effective method to restore impaired plasticity.\",\n",

       " 'Heightened aggression can be serious concerns for the individual and society at large and are symptoms of many psychiatric illnesses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The circuit and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-induced aggression increase, however, are poorly understood. Here we find that prior attack experience leading to an increase in aggressive behavior, known as aggression priming, activates neurons within the posterior ventral segment of the medial amygdala (MeApv). Optogenetic stimulation of MeApv using a synaptic depression protocol suppresses aggression priming, whereas high-frequency stimulation enhances aggression, mimicking attack experience. Interrogation of the underlying neural circuitry revealed that the MeApv mediates aggression priming via synaptic connections with the ventromedial hypothalamus (VmH) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). These pathways undergo NMDAR-dependent synaptic potentiation after attack. Furthermore, we find that the MeApv-VmH synapses selectively control attack duration, whereas the MeApv-BNST synapses modulate attack frequency, both with no effect on social behavior. Synaptic potentiation of the MeApv-VmH and MeApv-BNST pathways contributes to increased aggression induced by traumatic stress, and weakening synaptic transmission at these synapses blocks the effect of traumatic stress on aggression. These results reveal a circuit and synaptic basis for aggression modulation by experience that can be potentially leveraged toward clinical interventions.',\n",

Auxiliary α2δ subunits of VGCCs modulate trafficking and biophysical properties of the pore-forming α1 subunit and trigger excitatory synaptogenesis. Alterations in the expression level of α2δ subunits were implicated in several syndromes and diseases, including chronic neuropathic pain, autism, and epilepsy. However, the contribution of distinct α2δ subunits to excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and aberrant network connectivity characteristic for these pathologic conditions remains unclear. Here, we show that α2δ1 overexpression enhances spontaneous neuronal network activity in developing and mature cultures of hippocampal neurons. In contrast, overexpression, but not downregulation, of α2δ3 enhances neuronal firing in immature cultures, whereas later in development it suppresses neuronal activity. We found that α2δ1 overexpression increases excitatory synaptic density and selectively enhances presynaptic glutamate release, which is impaired on α2δ1 knockdown. Overexpression of α2δ3 increases the excitatory synaptic density as well but also facilitates spontaneous GABA release and triggers an increase in the density of inhibitory synapses, which is accompanied by enhanced axonaloutgrowth in immature interneurons. Together, our findings demonstrate that α2δ1 and α2δ3 subunits play distinct but complementary roles in driving formation of structural and functional network connectivity during early development. An alteration in α2δ surface expression during critical developmental windows can therefore play a causal role and have a profound impact on the excitatory-to-inhibitory balance and network connectivity.',\n",
       " 'To identify the neural correlates of perceptual awareness, researchers often compare the differences in neural activation between conditions in which an observer is or is not aware of a stimulus. While intuitive, this approach often contains a critical limitation: to link brain activity with perceptual awareness, observers traditionally report the contents of their perceptual experience. However, relying on observers\\' reports is problematic because it is difficult to know whether the neural responses being measured are associated with conscious perception or with postperceptual processes involved in the reporting task (e.g., working memory, decision-making). To address this issue, we combined a standard visual masking paradigm with a recently developed \"no-report\" paradigm in male/female human participants. In the visual masking paradigm, observers saw images of animals and objects that were visible or invisible, depending on their proximity to masks. Meanwhile, on half of the trials, observers reported the contents of their perceptual experience (i.e., report condition), while on the other half of trials they refrained from reporting about their experiences (i.e., no-report condition). We used electroencephalography to examine how visibility interacts with reporting by measuring the P3b event-related potential, one of the proposed canonical \"signatures\" of conscious processing. Overall, we found a robust P3b in the report condition, but no P3b whatsoever in the no-report condition. This finding suggests that the P3b itself is not a neural signature of conscious processing and highlights the importance of carefully distinguishing the neural correlates of perceptual awareness from postperceptual processing.',\n",

Learning this probability allows for appropriate computation of future harm to guide action selection. Impaired learning of this probability may be critical for the pathogenesis of anxiety or reckless and impulsive behavior. Here we designed a task for punishment probability learning during reward-guided actions to begin to understand the neuronal basis of this form of learning, and the biological or environmental variables that influence action selection after learning. Male and female Long-Evans rats were trained in a seek-take behavioral paradigm where the seek action was associated with varying probability of punishment. The take action remained safe and was followed by reward delivery. Learning was evident as subjects selectively adapted seek action behavior as a function of punishment probability. Recording of neural activity in the mPFC during learning revealed changes in phasic mPFC neuronal activity during risky-seek actions but not during the safe take actions or reward delivery, revealing that this region is involved in learning of probabilistic punishment. After learning, the variables that influenced behavior included reinforcer and punisher value, pretreatment with the anxiolytic diazepam, and biological sex. In particular, females were more sensitive to probabilistic punishment than males. These data demonstrate that flexible encoding of risky actions by mPFC is involved in probabilistic punishment learning and provide a novel behavioral approach for studying the pathogenesis of anxiety and impulsivity with inclusion of sex as a biological variable.',\n",

In experiment 1, 20 volunteers (8 males; 12 females) were cued (80% predictive) on a trial-by-trial basis to different objects (faces, scenes, or tools). Support vector machine decoding of alpha power patterns revealed that late (>500 ms latency) in the cue-to-target foreperiod, only EEG alpha differed with the to-be-attended object category. In experiment 2, to eliminate the possibility that decoding of the physical features of cues led to our results, 25 participants (9 males; 16 females) performed a similar task where cues were nonpredictive of the object category. Alpha decoding was now only significant in the early (<200 ms) foreperiod.

However, if electrical synapses were in axo-dendritic connections, where chemical synapses occur, the synaptic events would be mixed, having an electrical component preceding the chemical one. This type of communication is less well studied, mainly because it is not easily detected.

The prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been implicated in different aspects of avoidance and reward-seeking, but their respective contribution in instigating versus suppressing actions in aversive contexts remains to be clarified. We examined mPFC involvement in different forms of avoidance in rats well trained on different cued lever-press avoidance tasks. Active/inhibitory avoidance required flexible discrimination between auditory cues signaling foot-shock could be avoided by making or withholding instrumental responses. On a simpler active avoidance task, a single cue signaled when a lever press would avoid shock. PL inactivation disrupted active but not inhibitory avoidance on the discriminative task while having no effect on single-cued avoidance. In comparison, IL inactivation broadly impaired active and inhibitory avoidance. Conversely, on a cued appetitive go/no-go task, both IL and PL inactivation impaired inhibitory but not active reward-seeking, the latter effect being diametrically opposite to that observed on the avoidance task. These findings highlight the complex manner in which different mPFC regions aid in initiating or inhibiting actions in the service of avoiding aversive outcomes or obtaining rewarding ones. IL facilitates active avoidance but suppress inappropriate actions in appetitive and aversive contexts. In contrast, contextual valence plays a critical role in how the PL is recruited in initiating or suppressing actions, which may relate to the degree of cognitive control required to flexibly negotiate response or motivational conflicts and override prepotent behaviors.',\n",
       " 'Mitochondrial clusters are found at regions of high-energy demand, allowing cells to meet local metabolic requirements while maintaining neuronal homeostasis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key energy stress sensor, responds to increases in AMP/ATP ratio by activating multiple signaling cascades to overcome the energetic deficiency. In many neurologic conditions, the distal axon experiences energetic stress independent of the soma. Here, we used microfluidic devices to physically isolate these two neuronal structures and to investigate whether localized AMPK signaling influenced axonal mitochondrial transport. Nucleofection of primary cortical neurons, derived from E16-18 mouse embryos (both sexes), with mito-GFP allowed monitoring of the transport dynamics of mitochondria within the axon, by confocal microscopy. Pharmacological activation of AMPK at the distal axon (0.1 mm 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside) induced a depression of the mean frequency, velocity, and distance of retrograde mitochondrial transport in the adjacent axon. Anterograde mitochondrial transport was less sensitive to local AMPK stimulus, with the imbalance of bidirectional mitochondrial transport resulting in accumulation of mitochondria at the region of energetic stress signal. Mitochondria in the axon-rich white matter of the brain rely heavily on lactate as a substrate for ATP synthesis. Interestingly, localized inhibition of lactate uptake (10 nm AR-C155858) reduced mitochondrial transport in the adjacent axon in all parameters measured, similar to that observed by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside treatment.

       " 'Age-related cognitive impairments are associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linked to defined neural systems; however, studies examining multiple regions of the hippocampus fail to find links between behavior and transcription in the dentate gyrus (DG). We hypothesized that use of a task requiring intact DG function would emphasize molecular signals in the DG associated with a decline in performance. We used a water maze beacon discrimination task to characterize young and middle-age male F344 rats, followed by a spatial reference memory probe trial test. Middle-age rats showed increased variability in discriminating two identical beacons. Use of an allocentric strategy and formation of a spatial reference memory were not different between age groups; however, older animals compensated for impaired beacon discrimination through greater reliance on spatial reference memory. mRNA sequencing of hippocampal subregions indicated DEGs in the DG of middle-age rats, linked to synaptic function and neurogenesis, correlated with beacon discrimination performance, suggesting that senescence of the DG underlies the impairment. Few genes correlated with spatial memory across age groups, with a greater number in region CA1. Age-related CA1 DEGs, correlated with spatial memory, were linked to regulation of neural activity. These results indicate that the beacon task is sensitive to impairment in middle age, and distinct gene profiles are observed in neural circuits that underlie beacon discrimination performance and allocentric memory. The use of different strategies in older animals and associated transcriptional profiles could provide an animal model for examining cognitive reserve and neural compensation of aging.',\n",

Despite its importance, little is known about the molecular identity and functional roles of defined neuron types in the IC. Using a multifaceted approach in mice of both sexes, we found that neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression identifies a major class of inhibitory neurons, accounting for approximately one-third of GABAergic neurons in the IC. Retrograde tracing showed that NPY neurons are principal neurons that can project to the medial geniculate nucleus. In brain slice recordings, many NPY neurons fired spontaneously, suggesting that NPY neurons may drive tonic inhibition onto postsynaptic targets. Morphologic reconstructions showed that NPY neurons are stellate cells, and the dendrites of NPY neurons in the tonotopically organized central nucleus of the IC cross isofrequency laminae. Immunostaining confirmed that NPY neurons express NPY, and we therefore hypothesized that NPY signaling regulates activity in the IC. In crosses between ',\n",

In particular, the mechanisms that couple the external environment to the genomic changes underpinning this improvement are unknown. To address this, we have used male mice harboring an inactivating mutation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-activated enzyme downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that MSK1 is required for the full extent of experience-induced improvement of spatial memory, for the expansion of the dynamic range of synapses, exemplified by the enhancement of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), and for the regulation of the majority of genes influenced by enrichment. In addition, and unexpectedly, we show that experience is associated with an MSK1-dependent downregulation of key MAPK and plasticity-related genes, notably of EGR1/Zif268 and Arc/Arg3.1, suggesting the establishment of a novel genomic landscape adapted to experience. By coupling experience to homeostatic changes in gene expression MSK1, represents a prime mechanism through which the external environment has an enduring influence on gene expression, synaptic function, and cognition.',\n",

Here, we aimed to determine whether human amygdala neurons are involved in the computations necessary to implement learning through observation. We performed single-neuron recordings from the amygdalae of human neurosurgical patients (male and female) while they learned about the value of stimuli through observing the outcomes experienced by another agent interacting with those stimuli. We used a detailed computational modeling approach to describe patients' behavior in the task. We found a significant proportion of amygdala neurons whose activity correlated with both expected rewards for oneself and others, and in tracking outcome values received by oneself or other agents. Additionally, a population decoding analysis suggests the presence of information for both observed and experiential outcomes in the amygdala. Encoding and decoding analyses suggested observational value coding in amygdala neurons occurred in a different subset of neurons than experiential value coding. Collectively, these findings support a key role for the human amygdala in the computations underlying the capacity for learning through observation.\",\n",

Much is known about frontal and striatal processes that support cognitive control, but few studies have investigated how motor signals change during reactive and proactive adjustments in motor output. To address this, we characterized neural signals in red nucleus (RN), a brain region linked to motor control, as male and female rats performed a novel variant of the stop-signal task. We found that activity in RN represented the direction of movement and was strongly correlated with movement speed. Additionally, we found that directional movement signals were amplified on STOP trials before completion of the response and that the strength of RN signals was modulated when rats exhibited cognitive control. These results provide the first evidence that neural signals in RN integrate cognitive control signals to reshape motor outcomes reactively within trials and proactivity across them.',\n",
       " \"Phase locking of auditory-nerve-fiber (ANF) responses to the temporal fine structure of acoustic stimuli, a hallmark of the auditory system's temporal precision, is important for many aspects of hearing. Previous work has shown that phase-locked period histograms are often well described by exponential transfer functions relating instantaneous stimulus pressure to instantaneous spike rate, with no observed clipping of the histograms. The operating points and slopes of these functions change with stimulus level. The mechanism underlying this apparent gain control is unclear but is distinct from mechanical compression, is independent of refractoriness and spike-rate adaptation, and is apparently instantaneous. Here we show that these findings can be accounted for by a model consisting of a static Boltzmann transducer function yielding a clipped output, followed by a lowpass filter and a static exponential transfer function. Using responses to tones of ANFs from cats of both sexes, we show that, for a given ANF, the period histograms obtained at all stimulus levels for a given stimulus frequency can be described using one set of level-independent model parameters. The model also accounts for changes in the maximum and minimum instantaneous spike rates with changes in stimulus level. Notably, the estimated cutoff frequency is lower for low- than for high-spontaneous-rate ANFs, implying a synapse-specific contribution to lowpass filtering. These findings advance our understanding of ANF phase locking by highlighting the role of peripheral filtering mechanisms in shaping responses of individual ANFs.\",\n",

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy human participants (20 women, 8 men) to evaluate the hypothesis that the amygdala exerts an inhibitory influence that affects the \"gain\" of the gustatory system during tasting. Consistent with the existence of a central gain mechanism (CGM), we found that central amygdala response was correlated with mean intensity ratings across multiple tastants. In addition, psychophysiological and dynamic causal modeling analyses revealed that the connection strength between inhibitory outputs from amygdala to medial dorsal and ventral posterior medial thalamus predicted individual differences in responsiveness to taste stimulation. These results imply that inhibitory inputs from the amygdala to the thalamus act as a CGM that influences taste intensity perception.',\n",

Spindle and SO \"nesting,\" or the temporal overlap between the two events, is believed to modulate consolidation. However, the neurophysiological processes modified by nesting remain poorly understood. We thus recorded activity from the primary motor cortex of 4 male sleeping rats to investigate how SO and spindles interact to modulate the correlation structure of neural firing. During spindles, primary motor cortex neurons fired at a preferred phase, with neural pairs demonstrating greater neural synchrony, or correlated firing, during spindle peaks. We found a direct relationship between the temporal proximity between SO and spindles, and changes to the distribution of neural correlations; nesting was associated with narrowing of the distribution, with a reduction in low- and high-correlation pairs. Such narrowing may be consistent with greater exploration of neural states. Interestingly, after animals practiced a novel motor task, pairwise correlations increased during nested spindles, consistent with targeted strengthening of functional interactions. These findings may be key mechanisms through which spindle nesting supports memory consolidation.',\n",

This would allow adjusting pupil dynamics to environmental statistics to augment information transmission. We present image sequences containing internal temporal structure to humans of either sex and male macaque monkeys. We then measure whether the pupil tracks this temporal structure not only at the rate of luminance variations, but also at the rate of statistics not available from luminance information alone. We find entrainment to environmental statistics in both species. This entrainment directly affects visual processing by increasing sensitivity at the environmentally relevant temporal frequency. Thus, pupil dynamics are matched to the temporal structure of the environment to optimize perception, in line with an active sensing account.',\n",

One theory underlying this value-driven attentional capture (VDAC) is that reward-associated stimulus representations undergo plasticity in sensory cortex, thereby automatically capturing attention during early processing. To test this, we used magnetoencephalography to probe whether stimulus location and identity representations in sensory cortex are modulated by reward learning. We furthermore investigated the time course of these neural effects, and their relationship to behavioral VDAC. Male and female human participants first learned stimulus-reward associations. Next, we measured VDAC in a separate task by presenting these stimuli in the absence of reward contingency and probing their effects on the processing of separate target stimuli presented at different time lags. Using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis, we found that learned value modulated the spatial selection of previously rewarded stimuli in posterior visual and parietal cortex from ∼260 ms after stimulus onset. This value modulation was related to the strength of participants' behavioral VDAC effect and persisted into subsequent target processing. Importantly, learned value did not influence cortical signatures of early processing (i.e., earlier than ∼200 ms); nor did it influence the decodability of stimulus identity. Our results suggest that VDAC is underpinned by learned value signals that modulate spatial selection throughout posterior visual and parietal cortex. We further suggest that VDAC can occur in the absence of changes in early visual processing in cortex.\",\n",
       " 'Decades of research have shown that the NAc is a critical region influencing addiction, mood, and food consumption through its effects on reinforcement learning, motivation, and hedonic experience. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the NAc shell induces voracious feeding, leading to the hypothesis that the inhibitory projections that emerge from the NAc normally act to restrict feeding. While much of this work has focused on projections to the lateral hypothalamus, the role of NAc projections to the VTA in the control food intake has been largely unexplored. Using a retrograde viral labeling technique and real-time monitoring of neural activity with fiber photometry, we find that medial NAc shell projections to the VTA (mNAc→VTA) are inhibited during food-seeking and food consumption in male mice. We also demonstrate that this circuit bidirectionally controls feeding: optogenetic activation of NAc projections to the VTA inhibits food-seeking and food intake (in both sexes), while optogenetic inhibition of this circuit potentiates food-seeking behavior. Additionally, we show that activity of the NAc to VTA pathway is necessary for adaptive inhibition of food intake in response to external cues. These data provide new insight into NAc control over feeding in mice, and contribute to an emerging literature elucidating the role of inhibitory midbrain feedback within the mesolimbic circuit.',\n",

Parietal cortex compensates for this by updating reach goals relative to current gaze direction, but its role in the integration of oculomotor and visual orientation signals for updating grasp plans is unknown. Based on a recent perceptual experiment, we hypothesized that inferior parietal cortex (specifically supramarginal gyrus [SMG]) integrates saccade and visual signals to update grasp plans in additional intraparietal/superior parietal regions. To test this hypothesis in humans (7 females, 6 males), we used a functional magnetic resonance paradigm, where saccades sometimes interrupted grasp preparation toward a briefly presented object that later reappeared (with the same/different orientation) just before movement. Right SMG and several parietal grasp regions, namely, left anterior intraparietal sulcus and bilateral superior parietal lobule, met our criteria for transsaccadic orientation integration: they showed task-dependent saccade modulations and, during grasp execution, they were specifically sensitive to changes in object orientation that followed saccades. Finally, SMG showed enhanced functional connectivity with both prefrontal saccade regions (consistent with oculomotor input) and anterior intraparietal sulcus/superior parietal lobule (consistent with sensorimotor output). These results support the general role of parietal cortex for the integration of visuospatial perturbations, and provide specific cortical modules for the integration of oculomotor and visual signals for grasp updating.',\n",

The ventral division (vLGN) connects subcortically, sending inhibitory projections to sensorimotor structures, including the superior colliculus (SC) and regions associated with certain behavioral states, such as fear (Monavarfeshani et al., 2017; Salay et al., 2018). We combined computational, physiological, and anatomical approaches to explore visual processing in vLGN of mice of both sexes, making comparisons to dLGN and SC for perspective. Compatible with past, qualitative descriptions, the receptive fields we quantified in vLGN were larger than those in dLGN, and most cells preferred bright versus dark stimuli (Harrington, 1997). Dendritic arbors spanned the length and/or width of vLGN and were often asymmetric, positioned to collect input from large but discrete territories. By contrast, arbors in dLGN are compact (Krahe et al., 2011). Consistent with spatially coarse receptive fields in vLGN, visually evoked changes in spike timing were less precise than for dLGN and SC. Notably, however, the membrane currents and spikes of some cells in vLGN displayed gamma oscillations whose phase and strength varied with stimulus pattern, as for SC (Stitt et al., 2013). Thus, vLGN can engage its targets using oscillation-based and conventional rate codes. Finally, dark shadows activate SC and drive escape responses, whereas vLGN prefers bright stimuli. Thus, one function of long-range inhibitory projections from vLGN might be to enable movement by releasing motor targets, such as SC, from suppression.',\n",

The drug is used clinically to treat the Complex I disease Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), but has been less successful in clinical trials for other neurodegenerative diseases. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) appears to be the main intracellular enzyme catalyzing idebenone reduction. However, NQO1 is not universally expressed by cells of the brain. Using primary rat cortical cells pooled from both sexes, we tested the hypotheses that the level of endogenous NQO1 activity limits the ability of neurons, but not astrocytes, to use idebenone as an electron donor to support mitochondrial respiration. We then tested the prediction that NQO1 induction by pharmacological activation of the transcription factor nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) enables idebenone to bypass Complex I in cells with poor NQO1 expression. We found that idebenone stimulated respiration by astrocytes but reduced the respiratory capacity of neurons. Importantly, idebenone supported mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the presence of a Complex I inhibitor in astrocytes but not neurons, and this ability was reversed by inhibiting NQO1. Conversely, recombinant NQO1 delivery to neurons prevented respiratory impairment and conferred Complex I bypass activity. Nrf2 activators failed to increase NQO1 in neurons, but carnosic acid induced NQO1 in COS-7 cells that expressed little endogenous enzyme. Carnosic acid-idebenone combination treatment promoted NQO1-dependent Complex I bypass activity in these cells. Thus, combination drug strategies targeting NQO1 may promote the repurposing of idebenone for additional disorders.\",\n",

Meanwhile, the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) has been suggested to be critically involved in object size processing. To test for the potential contributions of feedback modulations on size representations in EVC, we investigated the dynamics of relevant processes using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Specifically, we briefly disrupted the neural activity of EVC and LOC at early, intermediate, and late time windows while participants performed size judgment tasks in either an illusory or neutral context. TMS over EVC and LOC allowed determining whether these two brain regions are relevant for generating phenomenological size impressions. Furthermore, the temporal order of TMS effects allowed inferences on the dynamics of information exchange between the two areas. Particularly, if feedback signals from LOC to EVC are crucial for generating altered size representations in EVC, then TMS effects over EVC should be observed simultaneously or later than the effects following LOC stimulation. The data from 20 humans (13 females) revealed that TMS over both EVC and LOC impaired illusory size perception. However, the strongest effects of TMS applied over EVC occurred later than those of LOC, supporting a functionally relevant feedback modulation from LOC to EVC for scaling size information. Our results suggest that context integration and the concomitant change of perceived size require LOC and result in modulating representations in EVC via recurrent processing.',\n",
       " 'Brefeldin A-resistant ArfGEF 2 (BRAG2) [or Iqsec1 (IQ motif and Sec7 domain-containing protein 1)] is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), a small GTPase implicated in the membrane trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomes. BRAG2 regulates Arf6-dependent endocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) through the direct interaction during the hippocampal long-term depression. However, the molecular mechanism by which the BRAG2-Arf6 pathway links AMPARs to the endocytic machinery remains elusive. Herein, using mouse brains of both sexes, we demonstrated that BRAG2a, an alternative isoform with a long C-terminal insert containing a proline-rich domain and type I PDZ-binding motif, was selectively localized to the excitatory postsynaptic density (PSD). Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified PSD-95 and endophilin 1/3 as BRAG2a-binding partners in the brain. The interaction with PSD-95 was required for synaptic targeting of BRAG2a. In cultured hippocampal neurons, stimulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) increased the interaction of BRAG2a with endophilin 3 and concomitant Arf6 activation in a time-dependent manner. Knockdown of BRAG2 in cultured hippocampal neurons blocked the mGluR-dependent decrease in surface AMPAR levels, which was rescued by introducing wild-type BRAG2a, but not wild-type BRAG2b or BRAG2a mutants lacking the ability to activate Arf6 or to interact with endophilin 3 or PSD-95. Further postembedding immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed the preorganized lateral distribution of BRAG2a, Arf6, and endophilin 3 for efficient endocytosis at the postsynaptic membrane. Together, the present findings unveiled a novel molecular mechanism by which BRAG2a links AMPARs to the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway through its interaction with PSD-95 and endophilin 3.',\n",

However, the relationship between neuronal activity and intracellular calcium in these neurons is unknown. Here we combined two-photon calcium imaging with whole-cell electrophysiology to determine how action potential firing drives calcium responses within subcellular compartments of male rat spinal cord lamina I neurons. We found that single action potentials generated at the soma increase calcium concentration in the somatic cytosol and nucleus, and these calcium responses invade dendrites and dendritic spines by active backpropagation. Calcium responses in each compartment were dependent on voltage-gated calcium channels, and somatic and nuclear calcium responses were amplified by release of calcium from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores. Grouping single action potential-evoked calcium responses by neuron type demonstrated their presence in all defined types, as well as a high degree of similarity in calcium responses between neuron types. With bursts of action potentials, we found that calcium responses have the capacity to encode action potential frequency and number in all compartments, with action potential number being preferentially encoded. Together, these findings indicate that intracellular calcium serves as a readout of neuronal activity within lamina I neurons, providing a unifying mechanism through which activity may regulate plasticity, including that seen in chronic pain.',\n",

In mammalian retina, gap junctions within the Aii amacrine cell-ON cone bipolar cell (CBC) network are essential for night vision, modulation of day vision, and contribute to visual impairment in retinal degenerations, yet neither the extended network topology nor its conservation is well established. Here, we map the network contribution of gap junctions using a high-resolution connectomics dataset of an adult female rabbit retina. Gap junctions are prominent synaptic components of ON CBC classes, constituting 5%-25% of all axonal synaptic contacts. Many of these mediate canonical transfer of rod signals from Aii cells to ON CBCs for night vision, and we find that the uneven distribution of Aii signals to ON CBCs is conserved in rabbit, including one class entirely lacking direct Aii coupling. However, the majority of gap junctions formed by ON CBCs unexpectedly occur between ON CBCs, rather than with Aii cells. Such coupling is extensive, creating an interconnected network with numerous lateral paths both within, and particularly across, these parallel processing streams. Coupling patterns are precise with ON CBCs accepting and rejecting unique combinations of partnerships according to robust rulesets. Coupling specificity extends to both size and spatial topologies, thereby rivaling the synaptic specificity of chemical synapses. These ON CBC coupling motifs dramatically extend the coupled Aii-ON CBC network, with implications for signal flow in both scotopic and photopic retinal networks during visual processing and disease.',\n",

The mammalian plasminogen activation (PA) system catalyzes the generation of plasmin via two activators: tissue-type (tPA) and urokinase-type (uPA). A dysfunctional tPA-plasmin system causes defective proteolytic degradation of Aβ plaques in advanced stages of AD. In contrast, it is unknown whether uPA and its receptor (uPAR) contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. Neuronal cadherin (NCAD) plays a pivotal role in the formation of synapses and dendritic branches, and Aβ decreases its expression in cerebral cortical neurons. Here we show that neuronal uPA protects the synapse from the harmful effects of soluble Aβ. However, Aβ-induced inactivation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α halts the transcription of uPA mRNA, leaving unopposed the deleterious effects of Aβ on the synapse. In line with these observations, the synaptic abundance of uPA, but not uPAR, is decreased in the frontal cortex of AD patients and 5xFAD mice, and in cerebral cortical neurons incubated with soluble Aβ. We found that uPA treatment increases the synaptic expression of NCAD by a uPAR-mediated plasmin-independent mechanism, and that uPA-induced formation of NCAD dimers protects the synapse from the harmful effects of soluble Aβ oligomers. These data indicate that Aβ-induced decrease in the synaptic abundance of uPA contributes to the development of synaptic damage in the early stages of AD.\",\n",

Here, we uncover tuning to subtle variations in frequency trajectories in auditory cortex of female mice. We found that auditory cortical responses could be modulated by variations in a pure tone trajectory as small as 1/24th of an octave, comparable to what has been reported in primates. In particular, late spiking after the end of a sound stimulus was more often sensitive to the sound\\'s subtle frequency variation compared with spiking during the sound.

As such, it may have intrinsic utility, guiding decisions toward environments that maximize instrumental power. Consistent with this notion, we found that a measure of expected value that treats instrumental divergence as a reward surrogate provided a better account of male and female human participants' choice preferences than did a conventional model, sensitive only to monetary reward. Using model-based fMRI, we found that activity in the rostrolateral and ventromedial PFC, regions associated with abstract cognitive inferences and subjective value computations, respectively, scaled with the divergence-based account of expected value.

Efforts to understand the organization of the M1 forelimb representation in monkeys have focused on inputs and outputs. In contrast, intrinsic M1 connections remain mostly unexplored, which is surprising given that intra-areal connections universally outnumber extrinsic connections. To address this knowledge gap, we first mapped the M1 forelimb representation with intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in male squirrel monkeys. Next, we determined the connectivity of individual M1 sites with ICMS + intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI). Every stimulation site activated a distinctive pattern of patches (∼0.25 to 1.0 mm radius) that we quantified in relation to the motor map. Arm sites activated patches that were mostly in arm zones. Hand sites followed the same principle, but to a lesser extent. The results collectively indicate that preferential connectivity between functionally matched patches is a prominent organizational principle in M1. Connectivity patterns for a given site were conserved across a range of current amplitudes, train durations, pulse frequencies, and microelectrode depths. In addition, we found close correspondence in somatosensory cortex between connectivity that we revealed with ICMS+ISOI and connections known from tracers. ICMS+ISOI is therefore an effective tool for mapping cortical connectivity and is particularly advantageous for sampling large numbers of sites. This feature was instrumental in revealing the spatial specificity of intrinsic M1 connections, which appear to be woven into the somatotopic organization of the forelimb representation.

The explicit reward category representation in OT is visible in the first sniff (50-100 ms) of an odor on each trial, and precedes the motor action. Together, these results suggest that the coding of stimulus information required for reward prediction does not occur within olfactory cortex, but rather in circuits involving the olfactory striatum.',\n",

Catecholamines are known to alter GH secretion and neurons expressing TH are located in several brain areas containing GH-responsive cells. However, whether TH-expressing neurons are required to regulate GH secretion via negative-feedback mechanisms is unknown. In the present study, we showed that between 50% and 90% of TH-expressing neurons in the periventricular, paraventricular, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei and locus ceruleus of mice exhibited STAT5 phosphorylation (pSTAT5) after an acute GH injection. Ablation of GH receptor (GHR) from TH cells or in the entire brain markedly increased GH pulse secretion and body growth in both male and female mice. In contrast, GHR ablation in cells that express the dopamine transporter (DAT) or dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH; marker of noradrenergic/adrenergic cells) did not affect body growth. Nevertheless, less than 50% of TH-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus were found to express DAT. Ablation of GHR in TH cells increased the hypothalamic expression of ',\n",

However, the nature of the MD network's contributions to language comprehension remains debated. To illuminate the role of this network in language processing in humans, we conducted a large-scale fMRI investigation using data from 30 diverse word and sentence comprehension experiments (481 unique participants [female and male], 678 scanning sessions). In line with prior findings, the MD network was active during many language tasks. Moreover, similar to the language-selective network, which is robustly lateralized to the left hemisphere, these responses were stronger in the left-hemisphere MD regions. However, in contrast with the language-selective network, the MD network responded more strongly (1) to lists of unconnected words than to sentences, and (2) in paradigms with an explicit task compared with passive comprehension paradigms. Indeed, many passive comprehension tasks failed to elicit a response above the fixation baseline in the MD network, in contrast to strong responses in the language-selective network. Together, these results argue against a role for the MD network in core aspects of sentence comprehension, such as inhibiting irrelevant meanings or parses, keeping intermediate representations active in working memory, or predicting upcoming words or structures. These results align with recent evidence of relatively poor tracking of the linguistic signal by the MD regions during naturalistic comprehension, and instead suggest that the MD network's engagement during language processing reflects effort associated with extraneous task demands.\",\n",
       " \"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective therapy for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the neural elements mediating symptom relief are unclear. A previous study concluded that direct optogenetic activation of STN neurons was neither necessary nor sufficient for relief of parkinsonian symptoms. However, the kinetics of the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) used for cell-specific activation are too slow to follow the high rates required for effective DBS, and thus the contribution of activation of STN neurons to the therapeutic effects of DBS remains unclear. We quantified the behavioral and neuronal effects of optogenetic STN DBS in female rats following unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion using an ultrafast opsin (Chronos). Optogenetic STN DBS at 130 pulses per second (pps) reduced pathologic circling and ameliorated deficits in forelimb stepping similarly to electrical DBS, while optogenetic STN DBS with ChR2 did not produce behavioral effects. As with electrical DBS, optogenetic STN DBS exhibited a strong dependence on stimulation rate; high rates produced symptom relief while low rates were ineffective. High-rate optogenetic DBS generated both increases and decreases in firing rates of single neurons in STN, globus pallidus externa (GPe), and substantia nigra pars reticular (SNr), and disrupted β band oscillatory activity in STN and SNr. High-rate optogenetic STN DBS can indeed ameliorate parkinsonian motor symptoms through reduction of abnormal oscillatory activity in the STN-associated neural circuit, and these results highlight that the kinetic properties of opsins have a strong influence on the effects of optogenetic stimulation.\",\n",
       " 'Neurons can respond to decreased network activity with a homeostatic increase in the amplitudes of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). The prevailing view is that mEPSC amplitudes are uniformly multiplied by a single factor, termed \"synaptic scaling.\" Deviations from purely multiplicative scaling have been attributed to biological differences, or to a distortion imposed by a detection threshold limit. Here, we demonstrate in neurons dissociated from cortices of male and female mice that the shift in mEPSC amplitudes observed in the experimental data cannot be reproduced by simulation of uniform multiplicative scaling, with or without the distortion caused by applying a detection threshold. Furthermore, we demonstrate explicitly that the scaling factor is not uniform but is close to 1 for small mEPSCs, and increases with increasing mEPSC amplitude across a substantial portion of the data. This pattern was also observed for previously published data from dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons and dissociated rat cortical neurons. The finding of \"divergent scaling\" shifts the current view of homeostatic plasticity as a process that alters all synapses on a neuron equally to one that must accommodate the differential effect observed for small versus large mEPSCs. Divergent scaling still accomplishes the essential homeostatic task of modifying synaptic strengths in the opposite direction of the activity change, but the consequences are greatest for those synapses which individually are more likely to bring a neuron to threshold.',\n",

The AP network is thought to be more sensitive to online manipulation of cerebellar (CB) activity using transcranial direct current stimulation. Here we probed CB-M1 interactions using cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI) in young healthy female and male individuals. TMS over the cerebellum produced maximal CBI of PA-evoked EMG responses at an interstimulus interval of 5 ms (PA-CBI), whereas the maximum effect on AP responses was at 7 ms (AP-CBI), suggesting that CB-M1 pathways with different conduction times interact with AP and PA networks. In addition, paired associative stimulation using ulnar nerve stimulation and PA TMS pulses over M1, a protocol used in human studies to induce cortical plasticity, reduced PA-CBI but not AP-CBI, indicating that cortical networks process cerebellar inputs in distinct ways. Finally, PA-CBI and AP-CBI were differentially modulated after performing two different types of motor learning tasks that are known to process cerebellar input in different ways. The data presented here are compatible with the idea that applying different TMS currents to the cerebral cortex may reveal cerebellar inputs to both the premotor cortex and M1. Overall, these results suggest that there are two independent CB-M1 networks that contribute uniquely to different motor behaviors.',\n",

It delivers long-range inhibition among different portions of the space map in the optic tectum (OT), thereby mediating stimulus competition in the OT. Here, we investigate the properties of relative strength-dependent competitive interactions within the Imc, in barn owls of both sexes. We find that when Imc neurons are presented simultaneously with one stimulus inside the receptive field and a second, competing stimulus outside, they exhibit gradual or switch-like response profiles as a function of relative stimulus strength. They do so both when the two stimuli are of the same sensory modality (both visual) or of different sensory modalities (visual and auditory). Moreover, Imc neurons signal the strongest stimulus in a dynamically flexible manner, indicating that Imc responses reflect an online comparison between the strengths of the competing stimuli. Notably, Imc neurons signal the strongest stimulus more categorically, and earlier than the OT. Paired recordings at spatially aligned sites in the Imc and OT reveal that although some properties of stimulus competition, such as the bias of competitive response profiles, are correlated, others such as the steepness of response profiles, are set independently. Our results demonstrate that the Imc is itself an active site of competition, and may be the first site in the midbrain selection network at which stimulus competition is resolved.',\n",

Here, we suggest that intrinsic plasticity of PCs is tightly involved in motor memory consolidation based on findings from PC-specific STIM1 knockout male mice, which show severe memory consolidation deficiency in vestibulo-ocular reflex memory. Gain-up training of the vestibulo-ocular reflex produced a decrease in the synaptic weight of PCs in both the WT and KO groups. However, intrinsic plasticity was impaired only in the knockout mice. Furthermore, the observed defects in the intrinsic plasticity of PCs led to the formation of aberrant neural plasticity in the vestibular nucleus neurons. Our results suggest that synergistic modulation of intrinsic and synaptic plasticity in PCs is required for the changes in downstream plasticity in the vestibular nucleus, and thereby contributing to the long-term storage of motor memory.',\n",
       " 'Vocal production is a sensory-motor process in which auditory self-monitoring is used to ensure accurate communication. During vocal production, the auditory cortex of both humans and animals is suppressed, a phenomenon that plays an important role in self-monitoring and vocal motor control. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of this vocalization-induced suppression are unknown. γ-band oscillations (>25 Hz) have been implicated a variety of cortical functions and are thought to arise from activity of local inhibitory interneurons, but have not been studied during vocal production. We therefore examined γ-band activity in the auditory cortex of vocalizing marmoset monkeys, of either sex, and found that γ responses increased during vocal production. This increase in γ contrasts with simultaneously recorded suppression of single-unit and multiunit responses. Recorded vocal γ oscillations exhibited two separable components: a vocalization-specific nonsynchronized (\"induced\") response correlating with vocal suppression, and a synchronized (\"evoked\") response that was also present during passive sound playback. These results provide evidence for the role of cortical γ oscillations during inhibitory processing. Furthermore, the two distinct components of the γ response suggest possible mechanisms for vocalization-induced suppression, and may correspond to the sensory-motor integration of top-down and bottom-up inputs to the auditory cortex during vocal production.',\n",

       " 'Neonatal tissue damage induces long-term deficits in inhibitory synaptic transmission within the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH) that include a reduction in primary afferent-evoked, feedforward inhibition onto adult projection neurons. However, the subpopulations of mature GABAergic interneurons which are compromised by early-life injury have yet to be identified. The present research illuminates the persistent effects of neonatal surgical injury on the function of inhibitory SDH interneurons derived from the prodynorphin (DYN) lineage, a population that synapses directly onto lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons and is known to suppress mechanical pain and itch in adults. The results demonstrate that hindpaw incision at postnatal day 3 (P3) significantly decreased the strength of primary afferent-evoked glutamatergic drive onto DYN neurons within the adult mouse SDH while increasing the appearance of afferent-evoked inhibition onto the same population. Neonatal injury also dampened the intrinsic membrane excitability of mature DYN neurons, and reduced their action potential discharge in response to sensory input, compared with naive littermate controls. Furthermore, P3 incision decreased the efficacy of inhibitory DYN synapses onto adult spinoparabrachial neurons, which reflected a prolonged reduction in the probability of GABA release. Collectively, the data suggest that early-life tissue damage may persistently constrain the ability of spinal DYN interneurons to limit ascending nociceptive transmission to the adult brain. This is predicted to contribute to the loss of feedforward inhibition onto mature projection neurons, and the \"priming\" of nociceptive circuits in the developing spinal cord, following injuries during the neonatal period.',\n",
       " 'Despite the success of reperfusion therapy in significantly reducing the extent of infarct expansion after stroke, the effect of revascularization on poststroke neuroinflammation and the role of anti-inflammatory strategies in postreperfusion era are yet to be explored. Here, we investigate whether the neuroinflammatory response may still contribute to neurologic deficits after reperfused stroke by using targeted complement inhibition to suppress poststroke neuroinflammation in mice with or without concurrent reperfusion therapy. Complement inhibition was achieved using B4Crry, an injury site-targeted inhibitor of C3 activation. Following embolic stroke in male C57bl/6 mice, thrombolysis using tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) reduced injury and improved motor deficits, but did not improve cognitive outcomes. After both reperfused and non-reperfused stroke, complement activation and opsonization of hippocampal synapses directed ongoing microglia-dependent phagocytosis of synapses for at least 30 d after stroke, leading to a loss of synaptic density that was associated with cognitive decline. B4Crry treatment, alone or in combination with tPA, limited perilesional complement deposition, reduced microgliosis and synaptic uptake, and improved cognitive outcome without affecting regenerative responses. Furthermore, complement inhibition improved the safety, efficacy, and treatment window of reperfusion therapy with t-PA by limiting hemorrhagic transformation. This work thus demonstrates that poststroke neuroinflammation contributes to hemorrhagic transformation and progression of neurodegenerative responses in the brain even following early and successful revascularization.',\n",
       " 'Male animals may show alternative behaviors toward infants: attack or parenting. These behaviors are triggered by pup stimuli under the influence of the internal state, including the hormonal environment and/or social experiences. Converging data suggest that the medial preoptic area (MPOA) contributes to the behavioral selection toward the pup. However, the neural mechanisms underlying how integrated stimuli affect the MPOA-dependent behavioral selection remain unclear. Here we focus on the amygdalohippocampal area (AHi) that projects to MPOA and expresses oxytocin receptor, a hormone receptor mediating social behavior toward pups. We describe the activation of MPOA-projection AHi neurons in male mice by social contact with pups. Input mapping using the TRIO method reveals that MPOA-projection AHi neurons receive prominent inputs from several regions, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and olfactory cortex. Electrophysiological and histologic analysis demonstrates that oxytocin modulates inhibitory synaptic responses on MPOA-projection AHi neurons. In addition, AHi forms the excitatory monosynapse to MPOA, and pharmacological activation of MPOA-projection AHi neurons enhances only aggressive behavior, but not parental behavior. Interestingly, this promoted behavior was related to social experience in male mice. Collectively, our results identified a presynaptic partner of MPOA that can integrate sensory input and hormonal state, and trigger pup-directed aggression.',\n",

Increased β bursts detected in the motor cortex have also been associated with longer reaction times (RTs) in healthy participants. Here we further hypothesize that suppressing β bursts through neurofeedback training can improve motor performance in healthy subjects. We conducted a double-blind sham-controlled study on 20 human volunteers (10 females) using a sequential neurofeedback-behavior task with the neurofeedback reflecting the occurrence of β bursts over sensorimotor cortex quantified in real time. The results show that neurofeedback training helps healthy participants learn to volitionally suppress β bursts in the sensorimotor cortex, with training being accompanied by reduced RT in subsequent cued movements. These changes were only significant in the real feedback group but not in the sham group, confirming the effect of neurofeedback training over simple motor imagery. In addition, RTs correlated with the rate and accumulated duration of β bursts in the contralateral motor cortex before the go-cue, but not with averaged β power. The reduced RTs induced by neurofeedback training positively correlated with reduced β bursts across all tested hemispheres. These results strengthen the link between the occurrence of β bursts in the sensorimotor cortex before the go-cue and slowed movement initiation in healthy motor control. The results also highlight the potential benefit of neurofeedback training in facilitating voluntary suppression of β bursts to speed up movement initiation.\",\n",

       " 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have highlighted that corticospinal excitability is increased during observation of object lifting, an effect termed \"motor resonance.\" This facilitation is driven by movement features indicative of object weight, such as object size or observed movement kinematics. Here, we investigated in 35 humans (23 females) how motor resonance is altered when the observer\\'s weight expectations, based on visual information, do not match the actual object weight as revealed by the observed movement kinematics. Our results highlight that motor resonance is not robustly driven by object weight but easily masked by a suppressive mechanism reflecting the correctness of weight expectations. Subsequently, we investigated in 24 humans (14 females) whether this suppressive mechanism was driven by higher-order cortical areas. For this, we induced \"virtual lesions\" to either the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) before having participants perform the task. Importantly, virtual lesion of pSTS eradicated this suppressive mechanism and restored object weight-driven motor resonance. In addition, DLPFC virtual lesion eradicated any modulation of motor resonance. This indicates that motor resonance is heavily mediated by top-down inputs from both pSTS and DLPFC. Together, these findings shed new light on the theorized cortical network driving motor resonance. That is, our findings highlight that motor resonance is not only driven by the putative human mirror neuron network consisting of the primary motor and premotor cortices as well as the anterior intraparietal sulcus, but also by top-down input from pSTS and DLPFC.',\n",

While certain aspects of water flow processing have been revealed through electrophysiology, we lack a comprehensive description of the neurons that respond to water flow and the network that they form. Here, we use brain-wide calcium imaging in combination with microfluidic stimulation to map out, at cellular resolution, neuronal responses involved in perceiving and processing water flow information in larval zebrafish. We find a diverse array of neurons responding to head-to-tail (h-t) flow, tail-to-head (t-h) flow, or both. Early in this pathway, in the lateral line ganglia, neurons respond almost exclusively to the simple presence of h-t or t-h flow, but later processing includes neurons responding specifically to flow onset, representing the accumulated displacement of flow during a stimulus, or encoding the speed of the flow. The neurons reporting on these more nuanced details are located across numerous brain regions, including some not previously implicated in water flow processing. A graph theory-based analysis of the brain-wide water flow network shows that a majority of this processing is dedicated to h-t flow detection, and this is reinforced by our finding that details like flow velocity and the total accumulated flow are only encoded for the h-t direction. The results represent the first brain-wide description of processing for this important modality, and provide a departure point for more detailed studies of the flow of information through this network.',\n",

Repetition is one cue that drives stream segregation in humans, but the neural basis of this perceptual phenomenon remains unknown. We demonstrated a similar perceptual ability in animals by training ferrets of both sexes to detect a stream of repeating noise samples (foreground) embedded in a stream of random samples (background). During passive listening, we recorded neural activity in primary auditory cortex (A1) and secondary auditory cortex (posterior ectosylvian gyrus, PEG). We used two context-dependent encoding models to test for evidence of streaming of the repeating stimulus. The first was based on average evoked activity per noise sample and the second on the spectro-temporal receptive field. Both approaches tested whether differences in neural responses to repeating versus random stimuli were better modeled by scaling the response to both streams equally (global gain) or by separately scaling the response to the foreground versus background stream (stream-specific gain). Consistent with previous observations of adaptation, we found an overall reduction in global gain when the stimulus began to repeat. However, when we measured stream-specific changes in gain, responses to the foreground were enhanced relative to the background. This enhancement was stronger in PEG than A1. In A1, enhancement was strongest in units with low sparseness (i.e., broad sensory tuning) and with tuning selective for the repeated sample. Enhancement of responses to the foreground relative to the background provides evidence for stream segregation that emerges in A1 and is refined in PEG.',\n",

The neural mechanism of effort investment is thought to be structured hierarchically, with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) at the highest level, recruiting task-specific upstream areas. In the current fMRI study, we tested whether dACC is generally active when effort demand is high across tasks with different stimuli, and whether connectivity between dACC and task-specific areas is increased depending on the task requirements and effort level at hand. For that purpose, a perceptual detection task was administered that required male and female human participants to detect either a face or a house in a noisy image. Effort demand was manipulated by adding little (low effort) or much (high effort) noise to the images. Results showed a network of dACC, anterior insula (AI), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) to be more active when effort demand was high, independent of the performed task (face or house detection). Importantly, effort demand modulated functional connectivity between dACC and face-responsive or house-responsive perceptual areas, depending on the task at hand.

       " 'Nestin, an intermediate filament protein widely used as a marker of neural progenitors, was recently found to be expressed transiently in developing cortical neurons in culture and in developing mouse cortex. In young cortical cultures, nestin regulates axonal growth cone morphology. In addition, nestin, which is known to bind the neuronal cdk5/p35 kinase, affects responses to axon guidance cues upstream of cdk5, specifically, to Sema3a. Changes in growth cone morphology require rearrangements of cytoskeletal networks, and changes in microtubules and actin filaments are well studied. In contrast, the roles of intermediate filament proteins in this process are poorly understood, even in cultured neurons. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which nestin affects growth cone morphology and Sema3a sensitivity. We find that nestin selectively facilitates the phosphorylation of the lissencephaly-linked protein doublecortin (DCX) by cdk5/p35, but the phosphorylation of other cdk5 substrates is not affected by nestin. We uncover that this substrate selectivity is based on the ability of nestin to interact with DCX, but not with other cdk5 substrates. Nestin thus creates a selective scaffold for DCX with activated cdk5/p35. Last, we use cortical cultures derived from ',\n",

We recorded from neurons in different levels of visual cortex of 2 male rhesus monkeys while the animals did a visual discrimination task and examined trial-to-trial correlations between neuronal and behavioral responses. These correlations became stronger in primary visual cortex as neuronal signals in that area became more reliable relative to the other areas.

       " 'Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporine, are widely used as standard immunosuppressants in organ transplantation recipients. However, these drugs can cause severe pain in patients, commonly referred to as calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome (CIPS). Although calcineurin inhibition increases NMDAR activity in the spinal cord, the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. Using an animal model of CIPS, we found that systemic administration of FK506 in male and female mice significantly increased the amount of α2δ-1-GluN1 complexes in the spinal cord and the level of α2δ-1-bound GluN1 proteins in spinal synaptosomes. Treatment with FK506 significantly increased the frequency of mEPSCs and the amplitudes of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root and puff NMDAR currents in spinal dorsal horn neurons. Inhibiting α2δ-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the α2δ-1-NMDAR interaction with α2δ-1Tat peptide completely reversed the effects of FK506. In α2δ-1 gene KO mice, treatment with FK506 failed to increase the frequency of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs and the amplitudes of evoked EPSCs and puff NMDAR currents in spinal dorsal horn neurons. Furthermore, systemic administration of gabapentin or intrathecal injection of α2δ-1Tat peptide reversed thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in FK506-treated mice. In addition, genetically deleting GluN1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons or α2δ-1 genetic KO similarly attenuated FK506-induced thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity.

Activity in anterior insular cortex (AIC), premotor cortex (PMd), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were modulated by prior belief on unexpected targets compared with expected targets. On expected targets, prior belief decreased the connection strength from AIC to IPL, whereas it increased the connection strength from AIC to PMd when targets were unexpected. Individual differences in the modulatory strength of prior belief on insular projections correlated with the precision that increases the influence of prediction errors on belief updating. These results suggest complementary effects of prior belief on insular-frontoparietal projections mediating the precision of prediction during probabilistic tactile learning.',\n",

       " 'The action potential (AP) waveform controls the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and contributes to the driving force for calcium ion flux that triggers neurotransmission at presynaptic nerve terminals. Although the frog neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has long been a model synapse for the study of neurotransmission, its presynaptic AP waveform has never been directly studied, and thus the AP waveform shape and propagation through this long presynaptic nerve terminal are unknown. Using a fast voltage-sensitive dye, we have imaged the AP waveform from the presynaptic terminal of male and female frog NMJs and shown that the AP is very brief in duration and actively propagated along the entire length of the terminal. Furthermore, based on measured AP waveforms at different regions along the length of the nerve terminal, we show that the terminal is divided into three distinct electrical regions: A beginning region immediately after the last node of Ranvier where the AP is broadest, a middle region with a relatively consistent AP duration, and an end region near the tip of nerve terminal branches where the AP is briefer. We hypothesize that these measured changes in the AP waveform along the length of the motor nerve terminal may explain the proximal-distal gradient in transmitter release previously reported at the frog NMJ.',\n",

       " 'Photoreceptor neurons are surrounded by an extracellular matrix, called the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM). Activities crucial to vision occur within the IPM, including trafficking of nutrients and metabolites, retinal attachment, and interactions needed for normal outer segment phagocytosis. The IPM includes the following two unique proteoglycans: IPM proteoglycan 1 (IMPG1) and IMPG2. Patients with mutations in IMPG1/IMPG2 develop visual deficits with subretinal material accumulation, highlighting the critical role of the IPM in vision. To determine the role of these proteoglycans in retinal physiology and the pathologic mechanisms that lead to vision loss, we generated mouse models lacking IMPG1/IMPG2. In normal retina, IMPG1 and IMPG2 occupy distinct IPM compartments, represent the main source of chondroitin sulfate and are fundamental for the constitution of the cone-specific glycocalyx stained by the PNA (peanut agglutinin) lectin marker. No evident morphologic or functional deficits were found in mice lacking IMPG1. In the absence of IMPG2, IMPG1 abnormally accumulated at the subretinal space need, likely leading to the formation of subretinal lesions and reduced visual function. Interestingly, mice lacking both IMPG1 and IMPG2, regardless of sex, showed normal retinal structure and function, demonstrating that the aberrant IMPG1 distribution is the main cause of the visual alterations observed in the absence of IMPG2. In conclusion, our results show the dependence of secreted proteoglycans such as IMPG1 on the extracellular environment to properly integrate into the matrix, demonstrate the role of IMPG2 in shaping the IPM, and shed light on the potential mechanisms leading to the development of subretinal lesions and vision loss.',\n",
       " 'Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized partly by atypical attentional engagement, reflected in exaggerated and variable responses to sensory stimuli. Attentional engagement is known to be regulated by the locus ceruleus (LC). Moderate baseline LC activity globally dampens neural responsivity and is associated with adaptive deployment and narrowing of attention to task-relevant stimuli. In contrast, increased baseline LC activity enhances neural responsivity across cortex and widening of attention to environmental stimuli regardless of their task relevance. Given attentional atypicalities in ASD, this study is the first to evaluate whether, under different attentional task demands, individuals with ASD exhibit a different profile of LC activity compared with typically developing controls. Males and females with ASD and age- and gender-matched controls participated in a one-back letter detection test while task-evoked pupillary responses, an established correlate for LC activity, were recorded. Participants completed this task in two conditions, either in the absence or presence of distractor auditory tones. Compared with controls, individuals with ASD evinced atypical pupillary responses in the presence versus absence of distractors. Notably, this atypical pupillary profile was evident despite the fact that both groups exhibited equivalent task performance. Moreover, between-group differences in pupillary responses were observed specifically in response to task-relevant events, providing confirmation that the group differences most likely were specifically associated with distinctions in LC activity. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD show atypical modulation of LC activity with changes in attentional demands, offering a possible mechanistic and neurobiological account for attentional atypicalities in ASD.',\n",
       " 'The superior colliculus (SC) is arguably the most important visual structure in the mouse brain and is well known for its involvement in innate responses to visual threats and prey items. In other species, the SC plays a central role in voluntary as well as innate visual functions, including crucial contributions to selective attention and perceptual decision-making. In the mouse, the possible role of the SC in voluntary visual choice behaviors has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse SC of both sexes plays a causal role in visual perceptual decision-making by transiently inhibiting SC activity during an orientation change detection task. First, unilateral SC inhibition-induced spatially specific deficits in detection. Hit rates were reduced, and reaction times increased for orientation changes in the contralateral but not ipsilateral visual field. Second, the deficits caused by SC inhibition were specific to a temporal epoch coincident with early visual burst responses in the SC. Inhibiting SC during this 100-ms period caused a contralateral detection deficit, whereas inhibition immediately before or after did not. Third, SC inhibition reduced visual detection sensitivity. Psychometric analysis revealed that inhibiting SC visual activity significantly increased detection thresholds for contralateral orientation changes. In addition, effects on detection thresholds and lapse rates caused by SC inhibition were larger in the presence of a competing visual stimulus, indicating a role for the mouse SC in visual target selection. Together, our results demonstrate that the mouse SC is necessary for the normal performance of voluntary visual choice behaviors.',\n",

       " \"Priming refers to the influence that a previously encountered object exerts on future responses to similar objects. For many years, visual priming has been known as a facilitation and sometimes an inhibition effect that lasts for an extended period of time. It contrasts with the recent finding of an oscillated priming effect where facilitation and inhibition alternate over time periodically. Here we developed a computational model of visual priming that combines rhythmic sampling of the environment (attentional oscillation) with active preparation for future events (temporal expectation). Counterintuitively, it shows that both the sustained and oscillated priming effects can emerge from an interaction between attentional oscillation and temporal expectation. The interaction also leads to novel predictions, such as the change of visual priming effects with temporal expectation and attentional oscillation. Reanalysis of two published datasets and the results of two new experiments of visual priming tasks with male and female human participants provide support for the model's relevance to human behavior. More generally, our model offers a new perspective that may unify the increasing findings of behavioral and neural oscillations with the classic findings in visual perception and attention.\",\n",
       " 'Microglial cells play essential volume-related actions in the brain that contribute to the maturation and plasticity of neural circuits that ultimately shape behavior. Microglia can thus be expected to have similar cell sizes and even distribution both across brain structures and across species with different brain sizes. To test this hypothesis, we determined microglial cell densities (the inverse of cell size) using immunocytochemistry to Iba1 in samples of free cell nuclei prepared with the isotropic fractionator from brain structures of 33 mammalian species belonging to males and females of five different clades. We found that microglial cells constitute ∼7% of non-neuronal cells in different brain structures as well as in the whole brain of all mammalian species examined. Further, they vary little in cell density compared with neuronal cell densities within the cerebral cortex, across brain structures, across species within the same clade, and across mammalian clades. As a consequence, we find that one microglial cell services as few as one and as many as 100 neurons in different brain regions and species, depending on the local neuronal density. We thus conclude that the addition of microglial cells to mammalian brains is governed by mechanisms that constrain the size of these cells and have remained conserved over 200 million years of mammalian evolution. We discuss the probable consequences of such constrained size for brain function in health and disease.',\n",

Although this type of pain usually subsides, at the extreme, viral infections can induce painful neuropathies that can last for decades. Neither of these types of pain sensitization is well understood. A key part of the response to viral infection is production of interferons (IFNs), which then activate their specific receptors (IFNRs) resulting in downstream activation of cellular signaling and a variety of physiological responses. We sought to understand how type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) might act directly on nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to cause pain sensitization. We demonstrate that type I IFNRs are expressed in small/medium DRG neurons and that their activation produces neuronal hyper-excitability and mechanical pain in mice. Type I IFNs stimulate JAK/STAT signaling in DRG neurons but this does not apparently result in PKR-eIF2α activation that normally induces an anti-viral response by limiting mRNA translation. Rather, type I IFNs stimulate MNK-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation in DRG neurons to promote pain hypersensitivity. Endogenous release of type I IFNs with the double-stranded RNA mimetic poly(I:C) likewise produces pain hypersensitivity that is blunted in mice lacking MNK-eIF4E signaling. Our findings reveal mechanisms through which type I IFNs cause nociceptor sensitization with implications for understanding how viral infections promote pain and can lead to neuropathies.',\n",
       " 'In an uncertain external environment, the motor system may need to respond rapidly to an unexpected stimulus. Limb displacement causes muscle stretch; the corrective response has multiple activity bursts, which are suggested to originate from different parts of the neuraxis. The earliest response is so fast, it can only be produced by spinal circuits; this is followed by slower components thought to arise from primary motor cortex (M1) and other supraspinal areas. Spinal cord (SC) contributions to the slower components are rarely considered. To address this, we recorded neural activity in M1 and the cervical SC during a visuomotor tracking task, in which 2 female macaque monkeys moved their index finger against a resisting motor to track an on-screen target. Following the behavioral trial, an increase in motor torque rapidly returned the finger to its starting position (lever velocity >200°/s). Many cells responded to this passive mechanical perturbation (M1: 148 of 211 cells, 70%; SC: 67 of 119 cells, 56%). The neural onset latency was faster for SC compared with M1 cells (21.7 ± 11.2 ms vs 25.5 ± 10.7 ms, respectively, mean ± SD). Using spike-triggered averaging, some cells in both regions were identified as likely premotor cells, with monosynaptic connections to motoneurons. Response latencies for these cells were compatible with a contribution to the muscle responses following the perturbation. Comparable fractions of responding neurons in both areas were active up to 100 ms after the perturbation, suggesting that both SC circuits and supraspinal centers could contribute to later response components.',\n",

Here we recorded neural activity simultaneously from the brain surface as well as at different depths of the bilateral S1/M1 in freely-moving male rats receiving nociceptive stimulation. GBOs measured from superficial layers of S1 contralateral to the stimulated paw not only had the largest magnitude, but also showed the strongest temporal and phase coupling with epidural GBOs. Also, spiking of superficial S1 interneurons had the strongest phase coherence with epidural GBOs.

       " 'As an important cognitive bias, the framing effect shows that our decision preferences are sensitive to the verbal description (i.e., frame) of options. This study focuses on the neural underpinnings of the social framing effect, which is based on decision-making regarding other people. A novel paradigm was used in which participants made a trade-off between economic benefits and the feelings of others. This decision was described as either a \"harm\" to, or \"not helping,\" other persons in two conditions (Harm frame vs Help frame). Both human males and females were recruited. Participants behaved more prosocially for Harm frame compared with Help frame, resulting in a significant social framing effect. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, Experiment 1 showed that the social framing effect was associated with stronger activation in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), especially its right part. The functional connectivity between the right TPJ (rTPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted the social framing effect on the group level. In Experiment 2, we used transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate the activity of the rTPJ and found that the social framing effect became more prominent under anodal (excitatory) stimulation, while the nonsocial framing effect elicited by the economic gain/loss gambling frame remained unaffected. The rTPJ results might be associated with moral conflicts modulated by the social consequences of an action or different levels of mentalizing with others under different frame conditions, but alternative interpretations are also worth noting. These findings could help elucidate the psychological mechanisms of the social framing effect.',\n",

We used rAAV2/5 to overexpress Nurr1 or GFP in the parkinsonian striatum of LID-resistant Lewis or LID-prone Fischer-344 (F344) male rats. In a second cohort, rats received the Nurr1 agonist amodiaquine (AQ) together with l-DOPA or ropinirole. All rats received a chronic DA agonist and were evaluated for LID severity. Finally, we performed single-unit recordings and dendritic spine analyses on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in drug-naïve rAAV-injected male parkinsonian rats. rAAV-GFP injected LID-resistant hemi-parkinsonian Lewis rats displayed mild LID and no induction of striatal Nurr1 despite receiving a high dose of l-DOPA. However, Lewis rats overexpressing Nurr1 developed severe LID. Nurr1 agonism with AQ exacerbated LID in F344 rats. We additionally determined that in l-DOPA-naïve rats striatal rAAV-Nurr1 overexpression (1) increased cortically-evoked firing in a subpopulation of identified striatonigral MSNs, and (2) altered spine density and thin-spine morphology on striatal MSNs; both phenomena mimicking changes seen in dyskinetic rats. Finally, we provide postmortem evidence of Nurr1 expression in striatal neurons of l-DOPA-treated PD patients. Our data demonstrate that ectopic induction of striatal Nurr1 is capable of inducing LID behavior and associated neuropathology, even in resistant subjects. These data support a direct role of Nurr1 in aberrant neuronal plasticity and LID induction, providing a potential novel target for therapeutic development.',\n",
       " 'Reward has a remarkable ability to invigorate motor behavior, enabling individuals to select and execute actions with greater precision and speed. However, if reward is to be exploited in applied settings, such as rehabilitation, a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms is required. In a series of experiments, we first demonstrate that reward simultaneously improves the selection and execution components of a reaching movement. Specifically, reward promoted the selection of the correct action in the presence of distractors, while also improving execution through increased speed and maintenance of accuracy. These results led to a shift in the speed-accuracy functions for both selection and execution. In addition, punishment had a similar impact on action selection and execution, although it enhanced execution performance across all trials within a block, that is, its impact was noncontingent to trial value. Although the reward-driven enhancement of movement execution has been proposed to occur through enhanced feedback control, an untested possibility is that it is also driven by increased arm stiffness, an energy-consuming process that enhances limb stability. Computational analysis revealed that reward led to both an increase in feedback correction in the middle of the movement and a reduction in motor noise near the target. In line with our hypothesis, we provide novel evidence that this noise reduction is driven by a reward-dependent increase in arm stiffness. Therefore, reward drives multiple error-reduction mechanisms which enable individuals to invigorate motor performance without compromising accuracy.',\n",

However, the effects of eliminating the DG on neural firing patterns in the CA3 have rarely been tested in a goal-directed memory task that requires both the DG and CA3. In this study, selective lesions in the DG were made using colchicine in male Long-Evans rats, and single units from the CA3 were recorded as the rats performed visual scene memory tasks. The original scenes used in training were altered during testing by blurring to varying degrees or by using visual masks, resulting in maximal recruitment of the DG-CA3 circuits. Compared with controls, the performance of rats with DG lesions was particularly impaired when blurred scenes were used in the task. In addition, the firing rate modulation associated with visual scenes in these rats was significantly reduced in the single units recorded from the CA3 when ambiguous scenes were presented, largely because DG-deprived CA3 cells did not show stepwise, categorical rate changes across varying degrees of scene ambiguity compared with controls. These findings suggest that the DG plays key roles not only during the acquisition of scene memories but also during retrieval when modified visual scenes are processed in conjunction with the CA3 by making the CA3 network respond orthogonally to ambiguous scenes.',\n",
       " 'Stress alters brain function by modifying the structure and function of neurons and astrocytes. The fine processes of astrocytes are critical for the clearance of neurotransmitters during synaptic transmission. Thus, experience-dependent remodeling of glial processes is anticipated to alter the output of neural circuits. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie glial structural plasticity are not known. Here we show that a single exposure of male and female mice to an acute stress produced a long-lasting retraction of the lateral processes of cerebellar Bergmann glial cells. These cells express the GluA1 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and GluA1 knockdown is known to shorten the length of glial processes. We found that stress reduced the level of GluA1 protein and AMPA receptor-mediated currents in Bergmann glial cells, and these effects were absent in mice devoid of CPEB3, a protein that binds to GluA1 mRNA and regulates GluA1 protein synthesis. Administration of a β-adrenergic receptor blocker attenuated the reduction in GluA1, and deletion of adenylate cyclase 5 prevented GluA1 suppression. Therefore, stress suppresses GluA1 protein synthesis via an adrenergic/adenylyl cyclase/CPEB3 pathway, and reduces the length of astrocyte lateral processes. Our results identify a novel mechanism for GluA1 subunit plasticity in non-neuronal cells and suggest a previously unappreciated role for AMPA receptors in stress-induced astrocytic remodeling.',\n",

We have recently reported that chronic pain is associated with amplified activity of PB neurons in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Here we demonstrate that similar activity amplification occurs in mice, and that this is related to suppressed inhibition to lateral parabrachial (LPB) neurons from the CeA in animals of either sex. Animals with pain after chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-Pain) displayed higher spontaneous and evoked activity in PB neurons, and a dramatic increase in after-discharges, responses that far outlast the stimulus, compared with controls. LPB neurons in CCI-Pain animals showed a reduction in inhibitory, GABAergic inputs. We show that, in both rats and mice, LPB contains few GABAergic neurons, and that most of its GABAergic inputs arise from CeA. These CeA GABA neurons express dynorphin, somatostatin, and/or corticotropin releasing hormone. We find that the efficacy of this CeA-LPB pathway is suppressed in chronic pain. Further, optogenetically stimulating this pathway suppresses acute pain, and inhibiting it, in naive animals, evokes pain behaviors. These findings demonstrate that the CeA-LPB pathway is critically involved in pain regulation, and in the pathogenesis of chronic pain.',\n",

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) exhibits anterograde transneuronal transport, however, the synaptic specificity of this spread and its broad application within a diverse set of circuits remains to be explored. Here, using anatomic, functional, and molecular approaches, we provide evidence for the preferential transport of AAV1 to postsynaptically connected neurons and reveal its spread is strongly dependent on synaptic transmitter release. In addition to glutamatergic pathways, AAV1 also spreads through GABAergic synapses to both excitatory and inhibitory cell types. We observed little or no transport, however, through neuromodulatory projections (e.g., serotonergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic). In addition, we found that AAV1 can be transported through long-distance descending projections from various brain regions to effectively transduce spinal cord neurons. Combined with newly designed intersectional and sparse labeling strategies, AAV1 can be applied within a wide variety of pathways to categorize neurons according to their input sources, morphology, and molecular identities. These properties make AAV1 a promising anterograde transsynaptic tool for establishing a comprehensive cell-atlas of the brain, although its capacity for retrograde transport currently limits its use to unidirectional circuits.',\n",

This large fMRI study on humans was intended to clarify the relations between hearing loss, tinnitus, and tonotopic reorganization. To determine the differential effect of hearing loss and tinnitus, both male and female participants with bilateral high-frequency hearing loss, with and without tinnitus, and a control group were included. In a total of 90 participants, bilateral cortical responses to sound stimulation were measured with loudness-matched pure-tone stimuli (0.25-8 kHz). In the bilateral auditory cortices, the high-frequency sound-evoked activation level was higher in both hearing-impaired participant groups, compared with the control group. This was most prominent in the hearing loss group without tinnitus. Similarly, the tonotopic maps for the hearing loss without tinnitus group were significantly different from the controls, whereas the maps of those with tinnitus were not. These results show that higher response amplitudes and map reorganization are a characteristic of hearing loss, not of tinnitus. Both tonotopic maps and response amplitudes of tinnitus participants appear intermediate to the controls and hearing loss without tinnitus group. This observation suggests a connection between tinnitus and an incomplete form of central compensation to hearing loss, rather than excessive adaptation. One implication of this may be that treatments for tinnitus shift their focus toward enhancing the cortical plasticity, instead of reversing it.',\n",

This includes the formation of fear memories when the anticipation of threat demands learning about temporal or contextual cues, as in trace fear conditioning. In this variant of fear learning, the association of a cue and shock across an empty trace interval of several seconds requires sustained cue-elicited firing in the prelimbic cortex (PL). However, it is unknown how and when distinct PL afferents contribute to different associative components of memory. Among the prominent inputs to PL, the hippocampus shares with PL a role in both working memory and contextual processing. Here we tested the necessity of direct hippocampal input to the PL for the acquisition of trace-cued fear memory and the simultaneously acquired contextual fear association. Optogenetic silencing of ventral hippocampal (VH) terminals in the PL of adult male Long-Evans rats selectively during paired trials revealed that direct communication between the VH and PL during training is necessary for contextual fear memory, but not for trace-cued fear acquisition. The pattern of the contextual memory deficit and the disruption of local PL firing during optogenetic silencing of VH-PL suggest that the VH continuously updates the PL with the current contextual state of the animal, which, when disrupted during memory acquisition, is detrimental to the subsequent rapid retrieval of aversive contextual associations.',\n",

Examining a large family of circuit models with non-identical neurons and synapses underlying rhythmic behavior, we analyzed the circuits' response to modifications in single and multiple intrinsic conductances in the individual neurons. To summarize these changes over the entire range of perturbed parameters, we quantified circuit output by defining a global stability measure. Using this measure, we identified specific subsets of conductances that when perturbed generate similar behavior in diverse individuals of the population. Our unbiased clustering analysis enabled us to quantify circuit stability when simultaneously perturbing multiple conductances as a nonlinear combination of single conductance perturbations. This revealed surprising conductance combinations that can predict the response to specific perturbations, even when the remaining intrinsic and synaptic conductances are unknown. Therefore, our approach can expose hidden variability in the balance of intrinsic and synaptic conductances of the same neurons across different versions of the same circuit solely from the circuit response to perturbations. Developed for a specific family of model circuits, our quantitative approach to characterizing high-dimensional degenerate systems provides a conceptual and analytic framework to guide future theoretical and experimental studies on degeneracy and robustness.\",\n",

These idiosyncratic biases and their neural underpinnings are often overlooked in studies on the physiology underlying perception. A potential candidate mechanism reflecting such idiosyncratic biases could be spontaneous alpha band activity, a prominent brain rhythm known to influence perceptual reports in general. Using a temporal order judgment task, we here tested the hypothesis that alpha power reflects the overcoming of an idiosyncratic bias. Importantly, to understand the interplay between idiosyncratic biases and contextual (temporary) biases induced by experimental manipulations, we quantified this relation before and after temporal recalibration. Using EEG recordings in human participants (male and female), we find that prestimulus frontal alpha power correlates with the tendency to respond relative to an own idiosyncratic bias, with stronger α leading to responses matching the bias. In contrast, alpha power does not predict response correctness. These results also hold after temporal recalibration and are specific to the alpha band, suggesting that alpha band activity reflects, directly or indirectly, processes that help to overcome an individual's momentary bias in perception. We propose that combined with established roles of parietal α in the encoding of sensory information frontal α reflects complementary mechanisms influencing perceptual decisions.\",\n",

In two studies, MEG and EEG activity was measured as human participants (both sexes) read three-sentence scenarios. Verbs in the final sentences constrained for either animate or inanimate semantic features of upcoming nouns, and the broader discourse context constrained for either a specific noun or for multiple nouns belonging to the same animacy category. We quantified the similarity between spatial patterns of brain activity following the verbs until just before the presentation of the nouns. The MEG and EEG datasets revealed converging evidence that the similarity between spatial patterns of neural activity following animate-constraining verbs was greater than following inanimate-constraining verbs. This effect could not be explained by lexical-semantic processing of the verbs themselves. We therefore suggest that it reflected the inherent difference in the semantic similarity structure of the predicted animate and inanimate nouns. Moreover, the effect was present regardless of whether a specific word could be predicted, providing strong evidence for the prediction of coarse-grained semantic features that goes beyond the prediction of individual words.',\n",
       " 'Pattern separation and completion are fundamental hippocampal computations supporting memory encoding and retrieval. However, despite extensive exploration of these processes, it remains unclear whether and how top-down processes adaptively modulate the dynamics between these computations. Here we examine the role of expectation in shifting the hippocampus to perform pattern separation. In a behavioral task, 29 participants (7 males) learned a cue-object category contingency. Then, at encoding, one-third of the cues preceding the to-be-memorized objects, violated the studied rule. At test, participants performed a recognition task with old objects (targets) and a set of parametrically manipulated (very similar to dissimilar) foils for each object. Accuracy was found to be better for foils of high similarity to targets that were contextually unexpected at encoding compared with expected ones. Critically, there were no expectation-driven differences for targets and low similarity foils. To further explore these effects, we implemented a computational model of the hippocampus, performing the same task as the human participants. We used representational similarity analysis to examine how top-down expectation interacts with bottom-up perceptual input, in each layer. All subfields showed more dissimilar representations for unexpected items, with dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 being more sensitive to expectation violation than CA1. Again, representational differences between expected and unexpected inputs were prominent for moderate to high levels of input similarity. This effect diminished when inputs from DG and CA3 into CA1 were lesioned. Overall, these novel findings strongly suggest that pattern separation in DG/CA3 underlies the effect that violation of expectation exerts on memory.',\n",
       " 'Adaptive coding of stimuli is well documented in perception, where it supports efficient encoding over a broad range of possible percepts. Recently, a similar neural mechanism has been reported also in value-based decision, where it allows optimal encoding of vast ranges of values in PFC: neuronal response to value depends on the choice context (relative coding), rather than being invariant across contexts (absolute coding). Additionally, value learning is sensitive to the amount of feedback information: providing complete feedback (both obtained and forgone outcomes) instead of partial feedback (only obtained outcome) improves learning. However, it is unclear whether relative coding occurs in all PFC regions and how it is affected by feedback information. We systematically investigated univariate and multivariate feedback encoding in various mPFC regions and compared three modes of neural coding: absolute, partially-adaptive and fully-adaptive.Twenty-eight human participants (both sexes) performed a learning task while undergoing fMRI scanning. On each trial, they chose between two symbols associated with a certain outcome. Then, the decision outcome was revealed. Notably, in one-half of the trials participants received partial feedback, whereas in the other half they got complete feedback. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to explore value encoding in different feedback conditions.We found that both obtained and forgone outcomes were encoded in mPFC, but with opposite sign in its ventral and dorsal subdivisions. Moreover, we showed that increasing feedback information induced a switch from absolute to relative coding. Our results suggest that complete feedback information enhances context-dependent outcome encoding.',\n",

In brain, PHB resides in mitochondria, where it forms a large protein complex with PHB2 in the inner TFmembrane, which serves as a scaffolding platform for proteins involved in mitochondrial structural and functional integrity. PHB overexpression at moderate levels provides neuroprotection in experimental brain injury models. In addition, PHB expression is involved in ischemic preconditioning, as its expression is enhanced in preconditioning paradigms. However, the mechanisms of PHB functional regulation are still unknown. Observations that nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in ischemia preconditioning compelled us to postulate that the neuroprotective effect of PHB could be regulated by NO. Here, we test this hypothesis in a neuronal model of ischemia-reperfusion injury and show that NO and PHB are mutually required for neuronal resilience against oxygen and glucose deprivation stress. Further, we demonstrate that NO post-translationally modifies PHB through protein S-nitrosylation and regulates PHB neuroprotective function, in a nitric oxide synthase-dependent manner. These results uncover the mechanisms of a previously unrecognized form of molecular regulation of PHB that underlies its neuroprotective function.',\n",

This fMRI study of male and female human participants combines univariate and multivariate analyses to consider the cortical representation of this more complex semantic knowledge. Using the categories of food, people, and places, this study investigates whether access to spatially related geographic semantic knowledge (1) involves the same domain-selective neural representations involved in access to prototypical taste knowledge about food; and (2) elicits activation of neural representations classically linked to places when this geographic knowledge is accessed about food and people. In three experiments using word stimuli, domain-relevant and atypical conceptual access for the categories food, people, and places were assessed. Results uncover two principles of semantic representation: food-selective representations in the left insula continue to be recruited when prototypical taste knowledge is task-irrelevant and under conditions of high cognitive demand; access to geographic knowledge for food and people categories involves the additional recruitment of classically place-selective parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial complex, and transverse occipital sulcus. These findings underscore the importance of object category in the representation of a broad range of knowledge, while showing how the cross recruitment of specialized representations may endow the considerable flexibility of our complex semantic knowledge.',\n",

In the present study, we use high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation to provide evidence that the rTPJ is causally associated with the embodied processes underpinning perspective-taking. Eighty-eight young human adults were stratified to receive either rTPJ or dorsomedial PFC anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation in a sham-controlled, double-blind, repeated-measures design. Perspective-tracking (line-of-sight) and perspective-taking (embodied rotation) were assessed using a visuo-spatial perspective-taking task that required understanding what another person could see or how they see it, respectively. Embodied processing was manipulated by positioning the participant in a manner congruent or incongruent with the orientation of an avatar on the screen. As perspective-taking, but not perspective-tracking, is influenced by bodily position, this allows the investigation of the specific causal role for the rTPJ in embodied processing. Crucially, anodal stimulation to the rTPJ increased the effect of bodily position during perspective-taking, whereas no such effects were identified during perspective-tracking, thereby providing evidence for a causal role for the rTPJ in the embodied component of perspective-taking. Stimulation to the dorsomedial PFC had no effect on perspective-tracking or taking. Therefore, the present study provides support for theories postulating that the rTPJ is causally involved in embodied cognitive processing relevant to social functioning.',\n",

       " 'The extraordinary diversity of excitatory synapse sizes is commonly attributed to activity-dependent processes that drive synaptic growth and diminution. Recent studies also point to activity-independent size fluctuations, possibly driven by innate synaptic molecule dynamics, as important generators of size diversity. To examine the contributions of activity-dependent and independent processes to excitatory synapse size diversity, we studied glutamatergic synapse size dynamics and diversification in cultured rat cortical neurons (both sexes), silenced from plating. We found that in networks with no history of activity whatsoever, synaptic size diversity was no less extensive than that observed in spontaneously active networks. Synapses in silenced networks were larger, size distributions were broader, yet these were rightward-skewed and similar in shape when scaled by mean synaptic size. Silencing reduced the magnitude of size fluctuations and weakened constraints on size distributions, yet these were sufficient to explain synaptic size diversity in silenced networks. Model-based exploration followed by experimental testing indicated that silencing-associated changes in innate molecular dynamics and fluctuation characteristics might negatively impact synaptic persistence, resulting in reduced synaptic numbers. This, in turn, would increase synaptic molecule availability, promote synaptic enlargement, and ultimately alter fluctuation characteristics. These findings suggest that activity-independent size fluctuations are sufficient to fully diversify glutamatergic synaptic sizes, with activity-dependent processes primarily setting the scale rather than the shape of size distributions. Moreover, they point to reciprocal relationships between synaptic size fluctuations, size distributions, and synaptic numbers mediated by the innate dynamics of synaptic molecules as they move in, out, and between synapses.',\n",
       " \"Navigation often requires movement in three-dimensional (3D) space. Recent studies have postulated two different models for how head direction (HD) cells encode 3D space: the rotational plane hypothesis and the dual-axis model. To distinguish these models, we recorded HD cells in female rats while they traveled different routes along both horizontal and vertical surfaces from an elevated platform to the top of a cuboidal apparatus. We compared HD cell preferred firing directions (PFDs) in different planes and addressed the issue of whether HD cell firing is commutative-does the order of the animal's route affect the final outcome of the cell's PFD? Rats locomoted a direct or indirect route from the floor to the cube top via one, two, or three vertical walls. Whereas the rotational plane hypothesis accounted for PFD shifts when the animal traversed horizontal corners, the cell's PFD was better explained by the dual-axis model when the animal traversed vertical corners. Responses also followed the dual-axis model (1) under dark conditions, (2) for passive movement of the rat, (3) following apparatus rotation, (4) for movement around inside vertical corners, and (5) across a 45° outside vertical corner. The order in which the animal traversed the different planes did not affect the outcome of the cell's PFD, indicating that responses were commutative. HD cell peak firing rates were generally equivalent along each surface. These findings indicate that the animal's orientation with respect to gravity plays an important role in determining a cell's PFD, and that vestibular and proprioceptive cues drive these computations.\",\n",
       " 'To date it is poorly understood how and when deviance processing interacts with awareness and task relevance. Furthermore, an important issue in the study of consciousness is the prevalent confound of conscious perception with the requirement of reporting it. This study addresses these topics using a no-report inattentional blindness paradigm with a visual oddball sequence of geometrical shapes presented to male and female human participants. Electrophysiological responses were obtained in three physically identical Phases A-C that differed only with respect to the instructions: (A) participants were uninformed about the shapes and attended an unrelated foreground task (inattentional blind), (B) were informed about the shapes but still attended the foreground task, and (C) attended the shapes. Conscious processing of shapes was indexed by the visual awareness negativity but not a P3. Deviance processing was associated with the visual mismatch negativity independently of consciousness and task relevance. The oddball P3, however, only emerged when the stimuli were task relevant, and was absent for consciously perceived but task irrelevant stimuli. The P3 thus does not represent a reliable marker of stimulus awareness. This result pattern supports the view of hierarchical predictive processing, where lower levels display automatic deviance processing, whereas higher levels require attention and task relevance.',\n",

       " 'Sensorimotor integration in the cerebellum is essential for refining motor output, and the first stage of this processing occurs in the granule cell layer. Recent evidence suggests that granule cell layer synaptic integration can be contextually modified, although the circuit mechanisms that could mediate such modulation remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of ACh in regulating granule cell layer synaptic integration in male rats and mice of both sexes. We find that Golgi cells, interneurons that provide the sole source of inhibition to the granule cell layer, express both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. While acute ACh application can modestly depolarize some Golgi cells, the net effect of longer, optogenetically induced ACh release is to strongly hyperpolarize Golgi cells. Golgi cell hyperpolarization by ACh leads to a significant reduction in both tonic and evoked granule cell synaptic inhibition. ACh also reduces glutamate release from mossy fibers by acting on presynaptic muscarinic receptors. Surprisingly, despite these consistent effects on Golgi cells and mossy fibers, ACh can either increase or decrease the spike probability of granule cells as measured by noninvasive cell-attached recordings. By constructing an integrate-and-fire model of granule cell layer population activity, we find that the direction of spike rate modulation can be accounted for predominately by the initial balance of excitation and inhibition onto individual granule cells. Together, these experiments demonstrate that ACh can modulate population-level granule cell responses by altering the ratios of excitation and inhibition at the first stage of cerebellar processing.',\n",

Therefore, it is highly probable that brain processes supporting language comprehension are at least partly independent of sensory modality. To identify where and when in the brain language processing is independent of sensory modality, we directly compared neuromagnetic brain signals of 200 human subjects (102 males) either reading or listening to sentences. We used multiset canonical correlation analysis to align individual subject data in a way that boosts those aspects of the signal that are common to all, allowing us to capture word-by-word signal variations, consistent across subjects and at a fine temporal scale. Quantifying this consistency in activation across both reading and listening tasks revealed a mostly left-hemispheric cortical network. Areas showing consistent activity patterns included not only areas previously implicated in higher-level language processing, such as left prefrontal, superior and middle temporal areas, and anterior temporal lobe, but also parts of the control network as well as subcentral and more posterior temporal-parietal areas. Activity in this supramodal sentence-processing network starts in temporal areas and rapidly spreads to the other regions involved.

Our objective was to compare beta power in the STN and GPi during rest and movement in people with PD undergoing DBS. Thirty-seven human female and male participants completed a simple behavioral experiment consisting of periods of rest and button presses, leading to local field potential recordings from 19 (15 participants) STN and 26 (22 participants) GPi nuclei. We examined overall beta power as well as beta time-domain dynamics (i.e., beta bursts). We found higher beta power during rest and movement in the GPi, which also had more beta desynchronization during movement. Beta power was positively associated with bradykinesia and rigidity severity; however, these clinical associations were present only in the GPi cohort. With regards to beta dynamics, bursts were similar in duration and frequency in the GPi and STN, but GPi bursts were stronger and correlated to bradykinesia-rigidity severity. Beta dynamics therefore differ across basal ganglia nuclei. Relative to the STN, beta power in the GPi may be readily detected, modulates more with movement, and relates more to clinical impairment. Together, this could point to the GPi as a potentially effective target for beta-based adaptive DBS.\",\n",

Here, we combined electrophysiology and real-time high-speed imaging of extracellular glutamate transients during LTP induction and characterized the sensitivity of the relationship between glutamate dynamics during theta burst stimulation (TBS) and the resulting magnitude of LTP consolidation, both in control conditions and following selective and nonselective glutamate transporter blockade. Glutamate clearance times were negatively correlated with LTP magnitude following nonselective glutamate transporter inhibition but not following selective blockade of a majority of GLT-1, the brain's most abundant glutamate transporter. Although glutamate transporter inhibition reduced the postsynaptic population response to TBS, calcium responses to TBS were greatly exaggerated. The source of excess calcium was dependent on NMDARs, L-type VGCCs, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, and internal calcium stores. Surprisingly, inhibition of L-type VGCCs, but not GluA2-lacking AMPARs or ryanodine receptors, was required to restore robust LTP.

Here we report that male mice knock-out (KO) for Ophn1 display hippocampal epileptiform alterations, which are associated with changes in parvalbumin-, somatostatin- and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons.

The orbital prefrontal cortex (PFo) has been associated with decision making, rule generation and maintenance, and more generally has been considered important for behavioral flexibility. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying the flexible behavior, we studied the ability to generate a switching signal in monkey PFo when a strategy is changed. In the strategy task, we used a visual cue to instruct two male rhesus monkeys either to repeat their most recent choice (i.e., stay strategy) or to change it (i.e., shift strategy). To identify the strategy switching-related signal, we compared nonswitch and switch trials, which cued the same or a different strategy from the previous trial, respectively. We found that the switching-related signal emerged during the cue presentation and it was combined with the strategy signal in a subpopulation of cells. Moreover, the error analysis showed that the activity of the switch-related cells reflected whether the monkeys erroneously switched or not the strategy, rather than what was required for that trial. The function of the switching signal could be to prompt the use of different strategies when older strategies are no longer appropriate, conferring the ability to adapt flexibly to environmental changes. In our task, the switching signal might contribute to the implementation of the strategy cued, overcoming potential interference effects from the strategy previously cued.

In this preclinical study, we examined the effects of delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia on functional recovery and neurodegeneration up to 3 months postinjury. A CSF1R inhibitor, Plexxikon (PLX) 5622, was administered to adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 month after controlled cortical impact to remove chronically activated microglia, and the inhibitor was withdrawn 1-week later to allow for microglial repopulation. Following TBI, the repopulated microglia displayed a ramified morphology similar to that of Sham uninjured mice, whereas microglia in vehicle-treated TBI mice showed the typical chronic posttraumatic hypertrophic morphology. PLX5622 treatment limited TBI-associated neuropathological changes at 3 months postinjury; these included a smaller cortical lesion, reduced hippocampal neuron cell death, and decreased NOX2- and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia after TBI led to widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome and altered gene pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. Using a variety of complementary neurobehavioral tests, PLX5622-treated TBI mice also had improved long-term motor and cognitive function recovery through 3 months postinjury.

It is thought that this ability is supported by large-scale patterns of activity across VTC that contain information about visual categories. However, it is unknown how category representations in VTC are organized at the submillimeter scale and across cortical depths. To fill this gap in knowledge, we measured BOLD responses in medial and lateral VTC to images spanning 10 categories from five domains (written characters, bodies, faces, places, and objects) at an ultra-high spatial resolution of 0.8 mm using 7 Tesla fMRI in both male and female participants. Representations in lateral VTC were organized most strongly at the general level of domains (e.g., places), whereas medial VTC was also organized at the level of specific categories (e.g., corridors and houses within the domain of places). In both lateral and medial VTC, domain-level and category-level structure decreased with cortical depth, and downsampling our data to standard resolution (2.4 mm) did not reverse differences in representations between lateral and medial VTC. The functional diversity of representations across VTC partitions may allow downstream regions to read out information in a flexible manner according to task demands.

Older listeners with age-related sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis) often struggle to understand speech in such situations, even when wearing a hearing aid. Yet, it is unclear whether a peripheral hearing loss degrades the attentional modulation of cortical speech tracking. Here, we used psychoacoustics and electroencephalography (EEG) in male and female human listeners to examine potential effects of hearing loss on EEG correlates of speech envelope synchronization in cortex. Behaviorally, older hearing-impaired (HI) listeners showed degraded speech-in-noise recognition and reduced temporal acuity compared with age-matched normal-hearing (NH) controls. During EEG recordings, we used a selective attention task with two spatially separated simultaneous speech streams where NH and HI listeners both showed high speech recognition performance. Low-frequency (<10 Hz) envelope-entrained EEG responses were enhanced in the HI listeners, both for the attended speech, but also for tone sequences modulated at slow rates (4 Hz) during passive listening. Compared with the attended speech, responses to the ignored stream were found to be reduced in both HI and NH listeners, allowing for the attended target to be classified from single-trial EEG data with similar high accuracy in the two groups. However, despite robust attention-modulated speech entrainment, the HI listeners rated the competing speech task to be more difficult. These results suggest that speech-in-noise problems experienced by older HI listeners are not necessarily associated with degraded attentional selection.',\n",

Mice of both sexes were studied. The CT neurons in S1 synaptically excited S1-projecting thalamocortical (TC) neurons in subregions of both the ventral posterior lateral and posterior (PO) nuclei, forming a pair of recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical (C-T-C) loops. The PT neurons in S1 also formed a recurrent loop with S1-projecting TC neurons in the same subregion of the PO. The PT neurons in the adjacent primary motor (M1) cortex formed a separate recurrent loop with M1-projecting TC neurons in a nearby subregion of the PO. Collectively, our results reveal that C-T-C circuits of mouse forelimb S1 are primarily organized as multiple cortical cell-type-specific and thalamic subnucleus-specific recurrent loops, with both CT and PT neurons providing the strongest excitatory input to TC neurons that project back to S1. The findings, together with those of related studies of C-T-C circuits, thus suggest that recurrently projecting thalamocortical neurons are the principal targets of cortical excitatory input to the mouse somatosensory and motor thalamus.',\n",
       " \"Microinjections of a glutamate AMPA antagonist (DNQX) in medial shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) can cause either intense appetitive motivation (i.e., 'desire') or intense defensive motivation (i.e., 'dread'), depending on site along a flexible rostrocaudal gradient and on environmental ambience. DNQX, by blocking excitatory AMPA glutamate inputs, is hypothesized to produce relative inhibitions of NAc neurons. However, given potential alternative explanations, it is not known whether neuronal inhibition is in fact necessary for NAc DNQX microinjections to generate motivations. Here we provide a direct test of whether local neuronal inhibition in NAc is necessary for DNQX microinjections to produce either desire or dread. We used optogenetic channelrhodopsin (ChR2) excitations at the same local sites in NAc as DNQX microinjections to oppose relative neuronal inhibitions induced by DNQX in female and male rats. We found that same-site ChR2 excitation effectively reversed the ability of NAc DNQX microinjections to generate appetitive motivation, and similarly reversed ability of DNQX microinjections to generate defensive motivation. Same-site NAc optogenetic excitations also attenuated recruitment of Fos expression in other limbic structures throughout the brain, which was otherwise elevated by NAc DNQX microinjections that generated motivation. However, to successfully reverse motivation generation, an optic fiber tip for ChR2 illumination needed to be located within <1 mm of the corresponding DNQX microinjector tip; that is, both truly at the same NAc site. Thus, we confirm that localized NAc neuronal inhibition is required for AMPA-blocking microinjections in medial shell to induce either positively-valenced 'desire' or negatively-valenced 'dread'.\",\n",
       " 'A fundamental feature of sleep is reduced behavioral responsiveness to external events, but the extent of processing along sensory pathways remains poorly understood. While responses are comparable across wakefulness and sleep in auditory cortex (AC), neuronal activity in downstream regions remains unknown. Here we recorded spiking activity in 435 neuronal clusters evoked by acoustic stimuli in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and in AC of freely behaving male rats across wakefulness and sleep. Neuronal responses in AC showed modest (∼10%) differences in response gain across vigilance states, replicating previous studies. By contrast, PRC neuronal responses were robustly attenuated by 47% and 36% during NREM sleep and REM sleep, respectively. Beyond the separation according to cortical region, response latency in each neuronal cluster was correlated with the degree of NREM sleep attenuation, such that late (>40 ms) responses in all monitored regions diminished during NREM sleep. The robust attenuation of late responses prevalent in PRC represents a novel neural correlate of sensory disconnection during sleep, opening new avenues for investigating the mediating mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'The neuromodulator dopamine plays a key role in motivation, reward-related learning, and normal motor function. The different affinity of striatal D1 and D2 dopamine receptor types has been argued to constrain the D1 and D2 signaling pathways to phasic and tonic dopamine signals, respectively. However, this view assumes that dopamine receptor kinetics are instantaneous so that the time courses of changes in dopamine concentration and changes in receptor occupation are basically identical. Here we developed a neurochemical model of dopamine receptor binding taking into account the different kinetics and abundance of D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum. Testing a large range of behaviorally-relevant dopamine signals, we found that the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations responded very similarly to tonic and phasic dopamine signals. Furthermore, because of slow unbinding rates, both receptor populations integrated dopamine signals over a timescale of minutes. Our model provides a description of how physiological dopamine signals translate into changes in dopamine receptor occupation in the striatum, and explains why dopamine ramps are an effective signal to occupy dopamine receptors. Overall, our model points to the importance of taking into account receptor kinetics for functional considerations of dopamine signaling.',\n",

       " 'Nonmuscle myosin II inhibition (NMIIi) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but not dorsal hippocampus (CA1), selectively disrupts memories associated with methamphetamine (METH) days after learning, without retrieval. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. A known function of NMII is to transiently activate synaptic actin dynamics with learning. Therefore, we hypothesized that METH-associated learning perpetuates NMII-driven actin dynamics in synapses, leading to an extended window of vulnerability for memory disruption. We used time-lapse two-photon imaging of dendritic spine motility in acutely prepared brain slices from female and male mice following METH-associated learning as a readout of actin-myosin dynamics. Spine motility was persistently increased in the BLA, but not in CA1. Consistent with the memory disrupting effect of intra-BLA NMII inhibition, METH-induced changes to BLA spine dynamics were reversed by a single systemic injection of an NMII inhibitor. Intra-CA1 NMII inhibition, on the other hand, did not disrupt METH-associated memory. Thus, we report identification of a previously unknown ability for spine actin dynamics to persist days after stimulation and that this is under the control of NMII. Further, these perpetual NMII-driven spine actin dynamics in BLA neurons may contribute to the unique susceptibility of METH-associated memories.',\n",
       " 'Neural signals recorded at different scales contain information about environment and behavior and have been used to control Brain Machine Interfaces with varying degrees of success. However, a direct comparison of their efficacy has not been possible due to different recording setups, tasks, species, etc. To address this, we implanted customized arrays having both microelectrodes and electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrodes in the primary visual cortex of 2 female macaque monkeys, and also recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), while they viewed a variety of naturalistic images and parametric gratings. Surprisingly, ECoG had higher information and decodability than all other signals. Combining a few ECoG electrodes allowed more accurate decoding than combining a much larger number of microelectrodes. Control analyses showed that higher decoding accuracy of ECoG compared with local field potential was not because of differences in low-level visual features captured by them but instead because of larger spatial summation of the ECoG. Information was high in the 30-80 Hz range and at lower frequencies. Information in different frequencies and scales was nonredundant. These results have strong implications for Brain Machine Interface applications and for study of population representation of visual stimuli.',\n",

       " 'A recent proposal posits that humans might use the same neuronal machinery to support the representation of both spatial and nonspatial information, organizing concepts and memories using spatial codes. This view predicts that the same neuronal coding schemes characterizing navigation in the physical space (tuned to distance and direction) should underlie navigation of abstract semantic spaces, even if they are categorical and labeled by symbols. We constructed an artificial semantic environment by parsing a bidimensional audiovisual object space into four labeled categories. Before and after a nonspatial symbolic categorization training, 25 adults (15 females) were presented with pseudorandom sequences of objects and words during a functional MRI session. We reasoned that subsequent presentations of stimuli (either objects or words) referring to different categories implied implicit movements in the novel semantic space, and that such movements subtended specific distances and directions. Using whole-brain fMRI adaptation and searchlight model-based representational similarity analysis, we found evidence of both distance-based and direction-based responses in brain regions typically involved in spatial navigation: the medial prefrontal cortex and the right entorhinal cortex (EHC). After training, both regions encoded the distances between concepts, making it possible to recover a faithful bidimensional representation of the semantic space directly from their multivariate activity patterns, whereas the right EHC also exhibited a periodic modulation as a function of traveled direction. Our results indicate that the brain regions and coding schemes supporting relations and movements between spatial locations in mammals are \"recycled\" in humans to represent a bidimensional multisensory conceptual space during a symbolic categorization task.',\n",

       " 'Reinforcement learning (RL) refers to the behavioral process of learning to obtain reward and avoid punishment. An important component of RL is managing explore-exploit tradeoffs, which refers to the problem of choosing between exploiting options with known values and exploring unfamiliar options. We examined correlates of this tradeoff, as well as other RL related variables, in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while three male monkeys performed a three-armed bandit learning task. During the task, novel choice options periodically replaced familiar options. The values of the novel options were unknown, and the monkeys had to explore them to see if they were better than other currently available options. The identity of the chosen stimulus and the reward outcome were strongly encoded in the responses of single OFC neurons. These two variables define the states and state transitions in our model that are relevant to decision-making. The chosen value of the option and the relative value of exploring that option were encoded at intermediate levels. We also found that OFC value coding was stimulus specific, as opposed to coding value independent of the identity of the option. The location of the option and the value of the current environment were encoded at low levels. Therefore, we found encoding of the variables relevant to learning and managing explore-exploit tradeoffs in OFC. These results are consistent with findings in the ventral striatum and amygdala and show that this monosynaptically connected network plays an important role in learning based on the immediate and future consequences of choices.',\n",

Here, using fine-scale high-end 3D electron microscopy, we demonstrate in adult male C57BL/6 wild-type mice marked differences between MC versus S1 Po synapses in (1) bouton and active zone size, (2) neurotransmitter vesicle pool size, (3) distribution of mitochondria around synapses, and (4) proportion of synapses established on dendritic spines and dendritic shafts. These differences are as large, or even more pronounced, than those between Po and ventro-posterior thalamic nucleus synapses in S1. Moreover, using single-axon transfection labeling, we demonstrate that the above differences actually occur on the MC versus the S1 branches of individual Po cell axons that innervate both areas. Along with recently-discovered divergences in efficacy and plasticity, the synaptic structure differences reported here thus reveal a new subcellular level of complexity. This is a finding that upends current models of thalamocortical circuitry, and that might as well illuminate the functional logic of other branched projection axon systems.',\n",
       " 'Seeing movement promotes survival. It results from an uncertain interplay between evolution and experience, making it hard to isolate the drivers of computational architectures found in brains. Here we seek insight into motion perception using a neural network (MotionNet) trained on moving images to classify velocity. The network recapitulates key properties of motion direction and speed processing in biological brains, and we use it to derive, and test, understanding of motion (mis)perception at the computational, neural, and perceptual levels. We show that diverse motion characteristics are largely explained by the statistical structure of natural images, rather than motion per se. First, we show how neural and perceptual biases for particular motion directions can result from the orientation structure of natural images. Second, we demonstrate an interrelation between speed and direction preferences in (macaque) MT neurons that can be explained by image autocorrelation. Third, we show that natural image statistics mean that speed and image contrast are related quantities. Finally, using behavioral tests (humans, both sexes), we show that it is knowledge of the speed-contrast association that accounts for motion illusions, rather than the distribution of movements in the environment (the \"slow world\" prior) as premised by Bayesian accounts. Together, this provides an exposition of motion speed and direction estimation, and produces concrete predictions for future neurophysiological experiments. More broadly, we demonstrate the conceptual value of marrying artificial systems with biological characterization, moving beyond \"black box\" reproduction of an architecture to advance understanding of complex systems, such as the brain.',\n",

       " 'We recently developed a rat model of relapse to drug seeking after food choice-induced voluntary abstinence. Here, we used this model to study the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its afferent projections in relapse to fentanyl seeking. We trained male and female rats to self-administer palatable food pellets for 6 d (6 h/d) and intravenous fentanyl (2.5 μg/kg/infusion) for 12 d (6 h/d). We assessed relapse to fentanyl seeking after 13-14 voluntary abstinence days, achieved through a discrete choice procedure between fentanyl infusions and palatable food (20 trials/d). In both sexes, relapse after food choice-induced abstinence was associated with increased expression of the activity marker Fos in the OFC. Pharmacological inactivation of the OFC with muscimol plus baclofen (50 + 50 ng/side) decreased relapse to fentanyl seeking. We then determined projection-specific activation of OFC afferents during the relapse test by using Fos plus the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (injected into the OFC). Relapse to fentanyl seeking was associated with increased Fos expression in the piriform cortex (Pir) neurons projecting to the OFC, but not in projections from the basolateral amygdala and thalamus. Pharmacological inactivation of the Pir with muscimol plus baclofen decreased relapse to fentanyl seeking after voluntary abstinence. Next, we used an anatomical disconnection procedure to determine whether projections between the Pir and OFC are critical for relapse to fentanyl seeking. Unilateral muscimol plus baclofen injections into the Pir in one hemisphere plus unilateral muscimol plus baclofen injections into the OFC in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemisphere decreased relapse. Our results identify Pir-OFC projections as a new motivation-related pathway critical to relapse to opioid seeking after voluntary abstinence.',\n",
       " \"Many tasks demand that information is kept online for a few seconds before it is used to guide behavior. The information is kept in working memory as the persistent firing of neurons encoding the memorized information. The neural mechanisms responsible for persistent activity are not yet well understood. Theories attribute an important role to ionotropic glutamate receptors, and it has been suggested that NMDARs are particularly important for persistent firing because they exhibit long time constants. Ionotropic AMPARs have shorter time constants and have been suggested to play a smaller role in working memory. Here we compared the contribution of AMPARs and NMDARs to persistent firing in the dlPFC of male macaque monkeys performing a delayed saccade to a memorized spatial location. We used iontophoresis to eject small amounts of glutamate receptor antagonists, aiming to perturb, but not abolish, neuronal activity. We found that both AMPARs and NMDARs contributed to persistent activity. Blockers of the NMDARs decreased persistent firing associated with the memory of the neuron's preferred spatial location but had comparatively little effect on the representation of the antipreferred location. They therefore decreased the information conveyed by persistent firing about the memorized location. In contrast, AMPAR blockers decreased activity elicited by the memory of both the preferred and antipreferred location, with a smaller effect on the information conveyed by persistent activity. Our results provide new insights into the contribution of AMPARs and NMDARs to persistent activity during working memory tasks.\",\n",
       " 'The AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA3 has been suggested to shape synaptic transmission and activity-dependent plasticity in endbulb-bushy cell synapses (endbulb synapses) in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, yet the specific roles of GluA3 in the synaptic transmission at endbulb synapses remains unexplored. Here, we compared WT and GluA3 KO mice of both sexes and identified several important roles of GluA3 in the maturation of synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity in endbulb synapses. We show that GluA3 largely determines the ultrafast kinetics of endbulb synapses glutamatergic currents by promoting the insertion of postsynaptic AMPARs that contain fast desensitizing flop subunits. In addition, GluA3 is also required for the normal function, structure, and development of the presynaptic terminal which leads to altered short term-depression in GluA3 KO mice. The presence of GluA3 reduces and slows synaptic depression, which is achieved by lowering the probability of vesicle release, promoting efficient vesicle replenishment, and increasing the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. Surprisingly, GluA3 also makes the speed of synaptic depression rate-invariant. We propose that the slower and rate-invariant speed of depression allows an initial response window that still contains presynaptic firing rate information before the synapse is depressed. Because this response window is rate-invariant, GluA3 extends the range of presynaptic firing rates over which rate information in bushy cells can be preserved. This novel role of GluA3 may be important to allowing the postsynaptic targets of spherical bushy cells in mice use rate information for encoding sound intensity and sound localization.',\n",
       " \"Chronic electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used tool for monitoring cortical electrical activity in experimental animals. Although chronic implants allow for high-quality, long-term recordings in preclinical studies, the electrodes are foreign objects and might therefore be expected to induce a local inflammatory response. We here analyzed the effects of chronic cranial electrode implantation on glymphatic fluid transport and in provoking structural changes in the meninges and cerebral cortex of male and female mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue and dura revealed reactive gliosis in the cortex underlying the electrodes and extensive meningeal lymphangiogenesis in the surrounding dura. Meningeal lymphangiogenesis was also evident in mice prepared with the commonly used chronic cranial window. Glymphatic influx of a CSF tracer was significantly enhanced at 30 d postsurgery in both awake and ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice with electrodes, supporting the concept that glymphatic influx and intracranial lymphatic drainage are interconnected. Altogether, the experimental results provide clear evidence that chronic implantation of EEG electrodes is associated with significant changes in the brain's fluid transport system. Future studies involving EEG recordings and chronic cranial windows must consider the physiological consequences of cranial implants, which include glial scarring, meningeal lymphangiogenesis, and increased glymphatic activity.\",\n",

To elucidate the induction rules leading to spatially structured forms of synaptic potentiation in dendrites, we explored plasticity of glutamate uncaging-evoked excitatory input patterns with various spatial distributions in perisomatic dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices from adult male rats. We show that (1) the cooperativity rules governing the induction of synaptic LTP depend on dendritic location; (2) LTP of input patterns that are subthreshold or suprathreshold to evoke local dendritic spikes (d-spikes) requires different spatial organization; and (3) input patterns evoking d-spikes can strengthen nearby, nonsynchronous synapses by local heterosynaptic plasticity crosstalk mediated by NMDAR-dependent MEK/ERK signaling. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms can trigger spatially organized synaptic plasticity on various spatial and temporal scales, enriching the ability of neurons to use synaptic clustering for information processing.',\n",

CE elevates humoral parameters, such as growth factors, and stimulates brain changes potentially relevant for learning and behavioral adaptations. However, the causal relationship between CE-induced brain changes and human's ability to learn remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that CE elicits a positive effect on learning via alterations in brain structure (morphological changes of gray and white matter) and function (functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow in resting state). We conducted a randomized controlled trial with healthy male and female human participants to compare the effects of a 2 week CE intervention against a non-CE control group on subsequent learning of a challenging new motor task (dynamic balancing; DBT) over 6 consecutive weeks. We used multimodal neuroimaging [T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI, and resting state functional MRI] to investigate the neural mechanisms mediating between CE and learning. As expected, subjects receiving CE subsequently learned the DBT at a higher rate. Using a modified nonparametric combination approach along with multiple mediator analysis, we show that this learning boost was conveyed by CE-induced increases in cerebral blood flow in frontal brain regions and changes in white matter microstructure in frontotemporal fiber tracts. Our study revealed neural mechanisms for the CE-learning link within the brain, probably allowing for a higher flexibility to adapt to highly novel environmental stimuli, such as learning a complex task.\",\n",

       " 'Previous research suggests that so-called implicit and explicit processes of motor adaptation are implemented by distinct neural structures. Here we tested whether implicit sensorimotor adaptation and strategic re-aiming used to reduce movement error are reflected by spatially distinct EEG oscillatory components. We analyzed beta-band oscillations (∼13-30 Hz), which have long been linked to sensorimotor functions, at the time when these adaptive processes intervene for movement planning. We hypothesized that beta-band activity within sensorimotor regions relates to implicit adaptive processes, whereas beta-band activity within medial motor areas reflects deliberate re-aiming. In female and male human volunteers, we recorded EEG in a motor adaptation task in which a visual rotation was introduced in short series of trials separated by unperturbed trials. Participants were instructed in advance about the nature of the visual perturbation and trained to counter it by strategically re-aiming at a neighboring target. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that preparatory beta-band activities within the two regions exhibited different patterns of modulation. Beta power in lateral central regions was attenuated when a change in the visual condition rendered internal-model predictions uncertain. In contrast, beta power in medial frontal regions was selectively decreased when participants strategically re-aimed their reaches. We propose that the reduction in lateral central beta power reflects an increased weighting of peripheral sensory information implicitly triggered when an adaptive change in the sensorimotor mapping is required, whereas the reduction in medial frontal beta-band activity relates to the inhibition of automatic motor responses in favor of cognitively controlled movements.',\n",
       " 'Memories for past experiences can range from vague recognition to full-blown recall of associated details. Electroencephalography has shown that recall signals unfold a few hundred milliseconds after simple recognition, but has only provided limited insights into the underlying brain networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed a \"core recollection network\" (CRN) centered on posterior parietal and medial temporal lobe regions, but the temporal dynamics of these regions during retrieval remain largely unknown. Here we used Magnetoencephalography in a memory paradigm assessing correct rejection (CR) of lures, item recognition (IR) and associative recall (AR) in human participants of both sexes. We found that power decreases in the alpha frequency band (10-12 Hz) systematically track different mnemonic outcomes in both time and space: Over left posterior sensors, alpha power decreased in a stepwise fashion from 500 ms onward, first from CR to IR and then from IR to AR. When projecting alpha power into source space, the CRN known from fMRI studies emerged, including posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and hippocampus. While PPC showed a monotonic change across conditions, hippocampal effects were specific to recall. These region-specific effects were corroborated by a separate fMRI dataset. Importantly, alpha power time courses revealed a temporal dissociation between item and associative memory in hippocampus and PPC, with earlier AR effects in hippocampus. Our data thus link engagement of the CRN to the temporal dynamics of episodic memory and highlight the role of alpha rhythms in revealing when and where different types of memories are retrieved.',\n",
       " 'Traditional views of sensorimotor adaptation (i.e., adaptation of movements to perturbed sensory feedback) emphasize the role of automatic, implicit correction of sensory prediction errors. However, latent memories formed during sensorimotor adaptation, manifest as improved relearning (e.g., savings), have recently been attributed to strategic corrections of task errors (failures to achieve task goals). To dissociate contributions of task errors and sensory prediction errors to latent sensorimotor memories, we perturbed target locations to remove or enforce task errors during learning and/or test, with male/female human participants. Adaptation improved after learning in all conditions where participants were permitted to correct task errors, and did not improve whenever we prevented correction of task errors. Thus, previous correction of task errors was both necessary and sufficient to improve adaptation. In contrast, a history of sensory prediction errors was neither sufficient nor obligatory for improved adaptation. Limiting movement preparation time showed that the latent memories driven by learning to correct task errors take at least two forms: a time-consuming but flexible component, and a rapidly expressible, inflexible component. The results provide strong support for the idea that movement corrections driven by a failure to successfully achieve movement goals underpin motor memories that manifest as savings. Such persistent memories are not exclusively mediated by time-consuming strategic processes but also comprise a rapidly expressible but inflexible component. The distinct characteristics of these putative processes suggest dissociable underlying mechanisms, and imply that identification of the neural basis for adaptation and savings will require methods that allow such dissociations.',\n",

These data suggest that activation of the OT system is necessary to direct behavior preferentially toward social stimuli. To determine whether the presence of a social stimulus is sufficient to induce activation of PVH-OT neurons, we performed the first definitive recording of OT neurons in awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging. These recordings demonstrate that social stimuli activate PVH-OT neurons and that these neurons differentially encode social and nonsocial stimuli, suggesting that PVH-OT neurons may act to convey social salience of environmental stimuli. Finally, an attenuation of social salience is associated with social disorders, such as autism. We therefore also examined possible OT system dysfunction in a mouse model of autism, ',\n",
       " 'Frequency discrimination learning is often accompanied by an expansion of the functional region corresponding to the target frequency within the auditory cortex. Although the perceptual significance of this plastic functional reorganization remains debated, greater cortical representation is generally thought to improve perception for a stimulus. Recently, the ability to expand functional representations through passive sound experience has been demonstrated in adult rats, suggesting that it may be possible to design passive sound exposures to enhance specific perceptual abilities in adulthood. To test this hypothesis, we exposed adult female Long-Evans rats to 2 weeks of moderate-intensity broadband white noise followed by 1 week of 7 kHz tone pips, a paradigm that results in the functional over-representation of 7 kHz within the adult tonotopic map. We then tested the ability of exposed rats to identify 7 kHz among distractor tones on an adaptive tone discrimination task. Contrary to our expectations, we found that map expansion impaired frequency discrimination and delayed perceptual learning. Rats exposed to noise followed by 15 kHz tone pips were not impaired at the same task. Exposed rats also exhibited changes in auditory cortical responses consistent with reduced discriminability of the exposure tone. Encouragingly, these deficits were completely recovered with training. Our results provide strong evidence that map expansion alone does not imply improved perception. Rather, plastic changes in frequency representation induced by bottom-up processes can worsen perceptual faculties, but because of the very nature of plasticity these changes are inherently reversible.',\n",

       " 'Goal-directed behavior can benefit from proactive adjustments of cognitive control that occur in anticipation of forthcoming cognitive control demands (CCD). Predictions of forthcoming CCD are thought to depend on learning and memory in two ways: First, through direct experience, associative encoding may link previously experienced CCD to its triggering item, such that subsequent encounters with the item serve to cue retrieval of (i.e., predict) the associated CCD. Second, in the absence of direct experience, pattern completion and mnemonic integration mechanisms may allow CCD to be generalized from its associated item to other items related in memory. While extant behavioral evidence documents both types of CCD prediction, the neurocognitive mechanisms giving rise to these predictions remain largely unexplored. Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) memory-guided predictions about CCD precede control adjustments due to the actual CCD required; and (2) generalization of CCD can be accomplished through integration mechanisms that link partially overlapping CCD-item and item-item associations in memory. Supporting these hypotheses, the temporal dynamics of theta and alpha power in human electroencephalography data (',\n",

Whereas the role played by cytokines as neuronal mediators is no longer contested, the mechanisms by which cytokines modulate pain processing remain to be elucidated. In this study, we have analyzed the involvement of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in nociceptor activation in male and female mice. Previous studies have suggested GM-CSF might directly activate neurons. However, here we established the absence of a functional GM-CSF receptor in murine nociceptors, and suggest an indirect mechanism of action, via immune cells. We report that GM-CSF applied directly to magnetically purified nociceptors does not induce any transcriptional changes in nociceptive genes. In contrast, conditioned medium from GM-CSF-treated murine macrophages was able to drive nociceptor transcription. We also found that conditioned medium from nociceptors treated with the well established pain mediator, nerve growth factor, could also modify macrophage gene transcription, providing further evidence for a bidirectional crosstalk.',\n",
       " 'Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an effective treatment for parkinsonian motor signs. Though its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, it has been suggested that antidromic activation of the primary motor cortex (M1) plays a significant role in mediating its therapeutic effects. This study tested the hypothesis that antidromic activation of M1 is a prominent feature underlying the therapeutic effect of STN and GPi DBS. Single-unit activity in M1 was recorded using high-density microelectrode arrays in two parkinsonian nonhuman primates each implanted with DBS leads targeting the STN and GPi. Stimulation in each DBS target had similar therapeutic effects, however, antidromic activation of M1 was only observed during STN DBS. Although both animals undergoing STN DBS had similar beneficial effects, the proportion of antidromic-classified cells in each differed, 30 versus 6%. Over 4 h of continuous STN DBS, antidromic activation became less robust, whereas therapeutic benefits were maintained. Although antidromic activation waned over time, synchronization of spontaneous spiking in M1 was significantly reduced throughout the 4 h. Although we cannot discount the potential therapeutic role of antidromic M1 activation at least in the acute phase of STN DBS, the difference in observed antidromic activation between animals, and target sites, raise questions about its hypothesized role as the primary mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of DBS. These results lend further support that reductions in synchronization at the level of M1 are an important factor in the therapeutic effects of DBS.',\n",
       " 'The ability of humans to reach and grasp objects in their environment has been the mainstay paradigm for characterizing the neural circuitry driving object-centric actions. Although much is known about hand shaping, a persistent question is how the brain orchestrates and integrates the grasp with lift forces of the fingers in a coordinated manner. The objective of the current study was to investigate how the brain represents grasp configuration and lift force during a dexterous object-centric action in a large sample of male and female human subjects. BOLD activity was measured as subjects used a precision-grasp to lift an object with a center of mass (CoM) on the left or right with the goal of minimizing tilting the object. The extent to which grasp configuration and lift force varied between left and right CoM conditions was manipulated by grasping the object collinearly (requiring a non-collinear force distribution) or non-collinearly (requiring more symmetrical forces). Bayesian variational representational similarity analyses on fMRI data assessed the evidence that a set of cortical and cerebellar regions were sensitive to grasp configuration or lift force differences between CoM conditions at differing time points during a grasp to lift action. In doing so, we reveal strong evidence that grasping and lift force are not represented by spatially separate functionally specialized regions, but by the same regions at differing time points. The coordinated grasp to lift effort is shown to be under dorsolateral (PMv and AIP) more than dorsomedial control, and under SPL7, somatosensory PSC, ventral LOC and cerebellar control.',\n",

However, previous reports of population-level response magnitude in individuals with autism have been inconsistent. Critically, network interactions have not been considered in previous neuroimaging studies of excitation and inhibition imbalance in autism. In particular, a defining characteristic of cortical organization is its hierarchical and interactive structure; sensory and cognitive systems are comprised of networks where later stages inherit and build upon the processing of earlier input stages, and also influence and shape earlier stages by top-down modulation. Here we used the well established connections of the human visual system to examine response magnitudes in a higher-order motion processing region [middle temporal area (MT+)] and its primary input region (V1).

In contrast to VTA, SNc DaNs engage calcium channels to generate action potentials, which lead to oxidant stress by yet unknown pathways. To determine the molecular mechanisms linking calcium load with selective cell death in the presence of mitochondrial deficiency, we analyzed the mitochondrial redox state and the mitochondrial membrane potential in mice of both sexes with genetically induced, severe mitochondrial dysfunction in DaNs (MitoPark mice), at the same time expressing a redox-sensitive GFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Despite mitochondrial insufficiency in all DaNs, exclusively SNc neurons showed an oxidized redox-system, i.e., a low reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH-GSSG) ratio. This was mimicked by cyanide, but not by rotenone or antimycin A, making the involvement of reactive oxygen species rather unlikely. Surprisingly, a high mitochondrial inner membrane potential was maintained in MitoPark SNc DaNs. Antagonizing calcium influx into the cell and into mitochondria, respectively, rescued the disturbed redox ratio and induced further hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our data therefore show that the constant calcium load in SNc DaNs is counterbalanced by a high mitochondrial inner membrane potential, even under conditions of severe mitochondrial dysfunction, but triggers a detrimental imbalance in the mitochondrial redox system, which will lead to neuron death. Our findings thus reveal a new mechanism, redox imbalance, which underlies the differential vulnerability of DaNs to mitochondrial defects.\",\n",
       " 'Distinct components of working memory are coordinated by different classes of inhibitory interneurons in the PFC, but the role of cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive interneurons remains enigmatic. In humans, this major population of interneurons shows histological abnormalities in schizophrenia, an illness in which deficient working memory is a core defining symptom and the best predictor of long-term functional outcome. Yet, CCK interneurons as a molecularly distinct class have proved intractable to examination by typical molecular methods due to widespread expression of CCK in the pyramidal neuron population. Using an intersectional approach in mice of both sexes, we have succeeded in labeling, interrogating, and manipulating CCK interneurons in the mPFC. Here, we describe the anatomical distribution, electrophysiological properties, and postsynaptic connectivity of CCK interneurons, and evaluate their role in cognition. We found that CCK interneurons comprise a larger proportion of the mPFC interneurons compared with parvalbumin interneurons, targeting a wide range of neuronal subtypes with a distinct connectivity pattern. Phase-specific optogenetic inhibition revealed that CCK, but not parvalbumin, interneurons play a critical role in the retrieval of working memory. These findings shine new light on the relationship between cortical CCK interneurons and cognition and offer a new set of tools to investigate interneuron dysfunction and cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.',\n",

In this study on male rat and mouse models of chronic neuropathic pain, we identify the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in central amygdala as a key epigenetic regulator that controls the development of comorbid emotional disorders underlying the individual vulnerability to chronic pain. We found that animals that were vulnerable to developing behaviors of anxiety and depression under the pain condition displayed reduced SIRT1 protein levels in central amygdala, but not those animals resistant to the emotional disorders. Viral overexpression of local SIRT1 reversed this vulnerability, but viral knockdown of local SIRT1 mimicked the pain effect, eliciting the pain vulnerability in pain-free animals.

       " 'The ependyma of the adult spinal cord is a latent stem cell niche that is reactivated by spinal cord injury contributing new cells to the glial scar. The cellular events taking place in the early stages of the reaction of the ependyma to injury remain little understood. Ependymal cells are functionally heterogeneous with a mitotically active subpopulation lining the lateral domains of the central canal (CC) that are coupled via gap junctions. Gap junctions and connexin hemichannels are key regulators of the biology of neural progenitors during development and in adult neurogenic niches. Thus, we hypothesized that communication via connexins in the CC is developmentally regulated and may play a part in the reactivation of this latent stem cell niche after injury. To test these possibilities, we combined patch-clamp recordings of ependymal cells with immunohistochemistry for various connexins in the neonatal and the adult (P > 90) normal and injured spinal cord of male and female mice. We find that coupling among ependymal cells is downregulated as postnatal development proceeds but increases after injury, resembling the immature CC. The increase in gap junction coupling in the adult CC was paralleled by upregulation of connexin 26, which correlated with the resumption of proliferation and a reduction of connexin hemichannel activity. Connexin blockade reduced the injury-induced proliferation of ependymal cells. Our findings suggest that connexins are involved in the early reaction of ependymal cells to injury, representing a potential target to improve the contribution of the CC stem cell niche to repair.',\n",

Using 2-photon microscopy and chronic imaging through a cranial window over the barrel cortex, we found that layer 2/3 neurones exhibit robust structural plasticity, but only in response to whisker deprivation patterns that cause functional plasticity. Chessboard pattern deprivation caused dual-component plasticity in layer 2/3 by (1) increasing production of new spines that subsequently persisted for weeks and (2) enlarging spine head sizes in the preexisting stable spine population. Structural plasticity occurred on basal dendrites, but not apical dendrites. Both components of plasticity were absent in α',\n",
       " \"In tonal music, continuous acoustic waveforms are mapped onto discrete, hierarchically arranged, internal representations of pitch. To examine the neural dynamics underlying this transformation, we presented male and female human listeners with tones embedded within a Western tonal context while recording their cortical activity using magnetoencephalography. Machine learning classifiers were then trained to decode different tones from their underlying neural activation patterns at each peristimulus time sample, providing a dynamic measure of their dissimilarity in cortex. Comparing the time-varying dissimilarity between tones with the predictions of acoustic and perceptual models, we observed a temporal evolution in the brain's representational structure. Whereas initial dissimilarities mirrored their fundamental-frequency separation, dissimilarities beyond 200 ms reflected the perceptual status of each tone within the tonal hierarchy of Western music. These effects occurred regardless of stimulus regularities within the context or whether listeners were engaged in a task requiring explicit pitch analysis. Lastly, patterns of cortical activity that discriminated between tones became increasingly stable in time as the information coded by those patterns transitioned from low-to-high level properties. Current results reveal the dynamics with which the complex perceptual structure of Western tonal music emerges in cortex at the timescale of an individual tone.\",\n",
       " 'Humans actively sample their environment with saccadic eye movements to bring relevant information into high-acuity foveal vision. Despite being lower in resolution, peripheral information is also available before each saccade. How the pre-saccadic extrafoveal preview of a visual object influences its post-saccadic processing is still an unanswered question. The current study investigated this question by simultaneously recording behavior and fixation-related brain potentials while human subjects made saccades to face stimuli. We manipulated the relationship between pre-saccadic \"previews\" and post-saccadic images to explicitly isolate the influences of the former. Subjects performed a gender discrimination task on a newly foveated face under three preview conditions: scrambled face, incongruent face (different identity from the foveated face), and congruent face (same identity). As expected, reaction times were faster after a congruent-face preview compared with a scrambled-face preview. Importantly, intact face previews (either incongruent or congruent) resulted in a massive reduction of post-saccadic neural responses. Specifically, we analyzed the classic face-selective N170 component at occipitotemporal electroencephalogram electrodes, which was still present in our experiments with active looking. However, the post-saccadic N170 was strongly attenuated following intact-face previews compared with the scrambled condition. This large and long-lasting decrease in evoked activity is consistent with a trans-saccadic mechanism of prediction that influences category-specific neural processing at the start of a new fixation. These findings constrain theories of visual stability and show that the extrafoveal preview methodology can be a useful tool to investigate its underlying mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'The brilliant and often prescient hypotheses of Ramon y Cajal have proven foundational for modern neuroscience, but his statement that \"In adult centers the nerve paths are something fixed, ended, immutable … \" is an exception that did not stand the test of empirical study. Mechanisms of cellular and circuit-level plasticity continue to shape and reshape many regions of the adult nervous system long after the neurodevelopmental period. Initially focused on neurons alone, the field has followed a meteoric trajectory in understanding of activity-regulated neurodevelopment and ongoing neuroplasticity with an arc toward appreciating neuron-glial interactions and the role that each neural cell type plays in shaping adaptable neural circuity. In this review, as part of a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Society for Neuroscience, we provide a historical perspective, following this arc of inquiry from neuronal to neuron-glial mechanisms by which activity and experience modulate circuit structure and function.

       " 'An increasing number of studies supports the view that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (TESS) promotes functional recovery in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the neural mechanisms contributing to these effects remain poorly understood. Here we examined motor-evoked potentials in arm muscles elicited by cortical and subcortical stimulation of corticospinal axons before and after 20 min of TESS (30 Hz pulses with a 5 kHz carrier frequency) and sham-TESS applied between C5 and C6 spinous processes in males and females with and without chronic incomplete cervical SCI. The amplitude of subcortical, but not cortical, motor-evoked potentials increased in proximal and distal arm muscles for 75 min after TESS, but not sham-TESS, in control subjects and SCI participants, suggesting a subcortical origin for these effects. Intracortical inhibition, elicited by paired stimuli, increased after TESS in both groups. When TESS was applied without the 5 kHz carrier frequency both subcortical and cortical motor-evoked potentials were facilitated without changing intracortical inhibition, suggesting that the 5 kHz carrier frequency contributed to the cortical inhibitory effects. Hand and arm function improved largely when TESS was used with, compared with without, the 5 kHz carrier frequency. These novel observations demonstrate that TESS influences cortical and spinal networks, having an excitatory effect at the spinal level and an inhibitory effect at the cortical level. We hypothesized that these parallel effects contribute to further the recovery of limb function following SCI.',\n",
       " 'Harmonic complex tones (HCTs) commonly occurring in speech and music evoke a strong pitch at their fundamental frequency (F0), especially when they contain harmonics individually resolved by the cochlea. When all frequency components of an HCT are shifted by the same amount, the pitch of the resulting inharmonic tone (IHCT) can also shift, although the envelope repetition rate is unchanged. A rate-place code, whereby resolved harmonics are represented by local maxima in firing rates along the tonotopic axis, has been characterized in the auditory nerve and primary auditory cortex, but little is known about intermediate processing stages. We recorded single-neuron responses to HCT and IHCT with varying F0 and sound level in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbits of both sexes. Many neurons showed peaks in firing rate when a low-numbered harmonic aligned with the neuron\\'s characteristic frequency, demonstrating \"rate-place\" coding. The IC rate-place code was most prevalent for F0 > 800 Hz, was only moderately dependent on sound level over a 40 dB range, and was not sensitive to stimulus harmonicity. A spectral receptive-field model incorporating broadband inhibition better predicted the neural responses than a purely excitatory model, suggesting an enhancement of the rate-place representation by inhibition. Some IC neurons showed facilitation in response to HCT relative to pure tones, similar to cortical \"harmonic template neurons\" (Feng and Wang, 2017), but to a lesser degree. Our findings shed light on the transformation of rate-place coding of resolved harmonics along the auditory pathway.',\n",
       " 'How temporal and contextual information interactively impact on behavior and brain activity during the retrieval of temporal order about naturalistic episodes remains incompletely understood. Here, we used fMRI to examine the effects of contextual signals derived from the content of the movie on the neural correlates underlying memory retrieval of temporal-order in human subjects of both sexes. By contrasting SAME versus DIFF storyline conditions during the retrieval of the temporal order of cinematic events, we found that the activation in the precuneus, as well as behavior, are significantly modulated according to storyline condition, supporting our prediction of contextual information contributing to temporal retrieval. We suggest that the precuneus engages in memory retrieval via reconstructive mechanisms, entailing search within a movie-specific, situational knowledge-structure. Furthermore, information-based analyses of multivoxel activity revealed that the precuneus also contains a context-independent linear representation of temporal distances, consistent with a chronological organization of memory traces. We thus put forward that the retrieval of the temporal-order of naturalistic events encoded in rich and dynamic contexts relies on the joint contribution of chronological and reconstructive mechanisms, both of which rely on the medioposterior parietal cortex in humans.',\n",

Atypical iron concentration in the basal ganglia is associated with neurodegenerative disorders in aging and cognitive deficits. However, the normative development of brain iron concentration in adolescence and its relationship to cognition are less well understood. Here, we address this gap in a longitudinal sample of 922 humans aged 8-26 years at the first visit (M = 15.1, SD = 3.72; 336 males, 486 females) with up to four multiecho T2* scans each. Using this sample of 1236 imaging sessions, we assessed the longitudinal developmental trajectories of tissue iron in the basal ganglia. We quantified tissue iron concentration using R2* relaxometry within four basal ganglia regions, including the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus. The longitudinal development of R2* was modeled using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) with splines to capture linear and nonlinear developmental processes. We observed significant increases in R2* across all regions, with the greatest and most prolonged increases occurring in the globus pallidus and putamen. Further, we found that the developmental trajectory of R2* in the putamen is significantly related to individual differences in cognitive ability, such that greater cognitive ability is increasingly associated with greater iron concentration through late adolescence and young-adulthood. Together, our results suggest a prolonged period of basal ganglia iron enrichment that extends into the mid-twenties, with diminished iron concentration associated with poorer cognitive ability during late adolescence.',\n",
       " \"Plastic change in neuronal connectivity is the foundation of memory encoding. It is not clear whether the changes during anesthesia can alter subsequent behavior.

Auditory neurons became responsive to the VS after the pairings. Moreover, high-frequency stimulation of axon terminals of entorhinal CCK neurons in the auditory cortex enabled LTP of the visual response in the auditory cortex. Such pairing during anesthesia also generated VS-induced freezing in an auditory fear conditioning task. Finally, we verified that direct inputs from the entorhinal CCK neurons and the visual cortex enabled the above neural plasticity in the auditory cortex. Our findings suggest that CCK-enabled visuoauditory association during anesthesia can be translated to the subsequent behavior action.\",\n",

In the hermaphroditic leech, T and P mechanosensory neurons respond to light touch and pressure on the skin, respectively. We show that the low threshold T cells were also sensitive to topological changes of the animal surface, caused by contraction of the muscles that erect the skin annuli. P cells were unresponsive to this movement. Annuli erection is part of the contraction phase of crawling, a leech locomotive behavior. In isolated ganglia, T cells showed phase-dependent IPSPs during dopamine-induced fictive crawling, whereas P cells were unaffected. The timing and magnitude of the T-IPSPs were highly correlated with the activity of the motoneurons excited during the contraction phase. Together, the results suggest that the central network responsible for crawling sends a reafferent signal onto the T cells, concomitant with the signal to the motoneurons. This reafference is specifically targeted at the sensory neurons that are affected by the movements; and it is behaviorally relevant as excitation of T cells affected the rhythmic motor pattern, probably acting upon the rhythmogenic circuit. Corollary discharge is a highly conserved function of motor systems throughout evolution, and we provide clear evidence of the specificity of its targets and timing and of the benefit of counteracting self-generated sensory input.',\n",
       " 'The declarative memory system allows us to accurately recognize a countless number of items and events, particularly those strengthened by repeated exposure. However, increased familiarity due to repetition can also lead to false recognition of related but new items, particularly when mechanisms supporting fine-grain mnemonic discrimination fail. The hippocampus is thought to be particularly important in separating overlapping cortical inputs during encoding so that similar experiences can be differentiated. In the current study of male and female human subjects, we examine how neural pattern similarity between repeated exemplars of a given concept (e.g., apple) influences true and false memory for target or lure images. Consistent with past work, we found that subsequent true recognition was related to pattern similarity between concept exemplars and the entire encoding set (global encoding similarity), particularly in ventral visual stream. In addition, memory for an individual target exemplar (a specific apple) could be predicted solely by the degree of pattern overlap between the other exemplars (different apple pictures) of that concept (concept-specific encoding similarity). Critically, subsequent false memory for lures was mitigated when high concept-specific similarity in cortical areas was accompanied by differentiated hippocampal representations of the corresponding exemplars. Furthermore, both true and false memory entailed the reinstatement of concept-related information at varying levels of specificity. These results link both true and false memory to a measure of concept strength expressed in the overlap of cortical representations, and importantly, illustrate how the hippocampus serves to separate concurrent cortical overlap in the service of detailed memory.',\n",

Our results implicate theta oscillations across the MTL as a common neurophysiological substrate for spatial coding in navigation and episodic recall. We further show that our index of retrieved spatial context is high in the hippocampus (HC) in an early time window preceding recall. Closer to recall, it decreases in the HC and increases in the parahippocampal gyrus.

However, the nature of cholinergic signaling in the brain remains controversial, with ongoing debates focused on the spatial and temporal resolution of ACh activity. Generally, opposing views have embraced a dichotomy between transmission as slow and volume-mediated versus fast and synaptic. Here, we provide the perspective that ACh, like most other neurotransmitters, exhibits both fast and slow modes that are strongly determined by the anatomy of cholinergic fibers, the distribution and the signaling mechanisms of receptor subtypes, and the dynamics of ACh hydrolysis. Current methodological approaches remain limited in their ability to provide detailed analyses of these underlying factors. However, we believe that the continued development of novel technologies in combination with a more nuanced view of cholinergic activity will open critical new avenues to a better understanding of ACh in the brain.',\n",
       " 'Conceptualizations of cholinergic signaling as primarily spatially diffuse and slow-acting are based largely on measures of extracellular brain ACh levels that require several minutes to generate a single data point. In addition, most such studies inhibited the highly potent catalytic enzyme for ACh, AChE, to facilitate measurement of ACh. Absent such inhibition, AChE limits the presence of ambient ACh and thus renders it unlikely that ACh influences target regions via slow changes in extracellular ACh concentrations. We describe an alternative view by which forebrain signaling in cortex driving cognition is largely phasic (milliseconds to perhaps seconds), and unlikely to be volume-transmitted. This alternative is supported by new evidence from real-time amperometric recordings of cholinergic signaling indicating a specific function of rapid, phasic, transient cholinergic signaling in attentional contexts. Previous neurochemical evidence may be reinterpreted in terms of integrated phasic cholinergic activity that mediates specific behavioral and cognitive operations; this reinterpretation fits well with recent computational models. Optogenetic studies support a causal relationship between cholinergic transients and behavior. This occurs in part via transient-evoked muscarinic receptor-mediated high-frequency oscillations in cortical regions. Such oscillations outlast cholinergic transients and thus link transient ACh signaling with more sustained postsynaptic activity patterns to support relatively persistent attentional biases. Reconceptualizing cholinergic function as spatially specific, phasic, and modulating specific cognitive operations is theoretically powerful and may lead to pharmacologic treatments more effective than those based on traditional views.',\n",

Here, using male Long-Evans rats in response-based and cue-based maze-running tasks, we demonstrate that phasic dorsolateral striatum (DLS) activity occurring at the onset of a learned behavior regulates how vigorous and habitual it is. In a response-based task, brief optogenetic excitation at the onset of runs decreased run duration and the occurrence of deliberative behaviors, whereas midrun stimulation carried little effect. Outcome devaluation showed these runs to be habitual. DLS inhibition at run start did not produce robust effects on behavior until after outcome devaluation. At that time, when the DLS was plausibly most critically required for performance (i.e., habitual), inhibition reduced performance vigor measures and caused a dramatic loss of habitual responding (i.e., animals quit the task). In a second cue-based \"beacon\" task requiring behavior initiation at the start of the run and again in the middle of the run, DLS excitation at both time points could improve the vigor of runs. Postdevaluation testing showed behavior on the beacon task to be habitual as well. This pattern of results suggests that one role for phasic DLS activity at behavior initiation is to promote the execution of the behavior in a vigorous and habitual fashion by a diverse set of measures.',\n",

       " 'Coherent neuronal dynamics play an important role in complex cognitive functions. Optogenetic stimulation promises to provide new ways to test the functional significance of coherent neural activity. However, the mechanisms by which optogenetic stimulation drives coherent dynamics remain unclear, especially in the nonhuman primate brain. Here, we perform computational modeling and experiments to study the mechanisms of optogenetic-stimulation-driven coherent neuronal dynamics in three male nonhuman primates. Neural responses arise from stimulation-evoked, temporally dynamic excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) activity. Spiking activity is more likely to occur during E/I imbalances. Thus the relative difference in the driven E and I responses precisely controls spike timing by forming a brief time interval of increased spiking likelihood. Experimental results agree with parameter-dependent predictions from the computational models. These results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation driven coherent neuronal dynamics are governed by the temporal properties of E/I activity. Transient imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory activity may provide a general mechanism for generating coherent neuronal dynamics without the need for an oscillatory generator.',\n",

       " 'The vestibulocollic reflex is a compensatory response that stabilizes the head in space. During everyday activities, this stabilizing response is evoked by head movements that typically span frequencies from 0 to 30 Hz. Transient head impacts, however, can elicit head movements with frequency content up to 300-400 Hz, raising the question whether vestibular pathways contribute to head stabilization at such high frequencies. Here, we first established that electrical vestibular stimulation modulates human neck motor unit (MU) activity at sinusoidal frequencies up to 300 Hz, but that sensitivity increases with frequency up to a low-pass cutoff of ∼70-80 Hz. To examine the neural substrates underlying the low-pass dynamics of vestibulocollic reflexes, we then recorded vestibular afferent responses to the same electrical stimuli in monkeys. Vestibular afferents also responded to electrical stimuli up to 300 Hz, but in contrast to MUs their sensitivity increased with frequency up to the afferent resting firing rate (∼100-150 Hz) and at higher frequencies afferents tended to phase-lock to the vestibular stimulus. This latter nonlinearity, however, was not transmitted to neck motoneurons, which instead showed minimal phase-locking that decreased at frequencies >75 Hz. Similar to human data, we validated that monkey muscle activity also exhibited low-pass filtered vestibulocollic reflex dynamics. Together, our results show that neck MUs are activated by high-frequency signals encoded by primary vestibular afferents, but undergo low-pass filtering at intermediate stages in the vestibulocollic reflex. These high-frequency contributions to vestibular-evoked neck muscle responses could stabilize the head during unexpected head transients.',\n",
       " 'Memory consolidation is hypothesized to involve the distribution and restructuring of memory representations across hippocampal and cortical regions. Theories suggest that, through extended hippocampal-cortical interactions, cortical ensembles come to represent more integrated, or overlapping, memory traces that prioritize commonalities across related memories. Sleep processes, particularly fast sleep spindles, are thought to support consolidation, but evidence for this relationship has been mostly limited to memory retention benefits. Whether fast spindles provide a mechanism for neural changes hypothesized to support consolidation, including the strengthening of hippocampal-cortical networks and integration across memory representations, remains unclear, as does the specificity of regions involved. Using functional connectivity analyses of human fMRI data (both sexes), we show that fast spindle density during overnight sleep is related to enhanced hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity the next day, when restudying information learned before sleep. Spindle density modulated connectivity in distinct hippocampal-cortical networks depending on the category of the consolidated stimuli. Specifically, spindle density correlated with functional connectivity between anterior hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) for object-word pairs, and posterior hippocampus and posteromedial cortex for scene-word pairs. Using multivariate pattern analyses, we also show that fast spindle density during postlearning sleep is associated with greater pattern similarity, or representational overlap, across individual object-word memories in vmPFC the next day. Further, the relationship between fast spindle density and representational overlap in vmPFC was mediated by the degree of anterior hippocampal-vmPFC functional connectivity. Together, these results suggest that fast spindles support the network distribution of memory traces, potentially restructuring memory representations in vmPFC.',\n",
       " 'The loss of sensory input following a spinal deafferentation injury can be debilitating, and this is especially true in primates when the hand is involved. Although significant recovery of function occurs, little is currently understood about the reorganization of the neuronal circuitry, particularly within the dorsal horn. This region receives primary afferent input from the periphery, and cortical input via the somatosensory subcomponent of the corticospinal tract (S1 CST), and is critically important in modulating sensory transmission, both in normal and lesioned states. To determine how dorsal horn circuitry alters to facilitate recovery post-injury, we used an established deafferentation lesion model (dorsal root/dorsal column) in male monkeys to remove sensory input from just the opposing digits (digits 1-3) of one hand. This results in a deficit in fine dexterity that recovers over several months. Electrophysiological mapping, tract tracing, and immunolabeling techniques were combined to delineate specific changes to dorsal horn input circuitry. Our main findings show that (1) there is complementary sprouting of the primary afferent and S1 CST populations into an overlapping region of the reorganizing dorsal horn; (2) S1 CST and primary afferent inputs connect in different ways within this region to facilitate sensory integration; and (3) there is a loss of larger S1 CST terminal boutons in the affected dorsal horn, but no change in the size profile of the spared/sprouted primary afferent terminal boutons post-lesion. Understanding such changes helps to inform new and targeted therapies that best promote recovery.',\n",
       " 'Multiple insults to the brain lead to neuronal cell death, thus raising the question to what extent can lost neurons be replenished by adult neurogenesis. Here we focused on the hippocampus and especially the dentate gyrus (DG), a vulnerable brain region and one of the two sites where adult neuronal stem cells (NSCs) reside. While adult hippocampal neurogenesis was extensively studied with regard to its contribution to cognitive enhancement, we focused on their underestimated capability to repair a massively injured, nonfunctional DG. To address this issue, we inflicted substantial DG-specific damage in mice of either sex either by diphtheria toxin-based ablation of >50% of mature DG granule cells (GCs) or by prolonged brain-specific VEGF overexpression culminating in extensive, highly selective loss of DG GCs (thereby also reinforcing the notion of selective DG vulnerability). The neurogenic system promoted effective regeneration by increasing NSCs proliferation/survival rates, restoring a nearly original DG mass, promoting proper rewiring of regenerated neurons to their afferent and efferent partners, and regaining of lost spatial memory. Notably, concomitantly with the natural age-related decline in the levels of neurogenesis, the regenerative capacity of the hippocampus also subsided with age. The study thus revealed an unappreciated regenerative potential of the young DG and suggests hippocampal NSCs as a critical reservoir enabling recovery from catastrophic DG damage.',\n",

Previous studies reported the volume and thickness of the neocortex to be altered in children and adolescents diagnosed with OSB. Until now, the onset and the underlying cause of the atypical neocortex organization in OSB patients remain largely unknown. To examine the effects of OSB on fetal neocortex development, we analyzed human fetuses of both sexes diagnosed with OSB between 11 and 15 weeks of gestation by immunofluorescence for established neuronal and neural progenitor marker proteins and compared the results with healthy controls of the same, or very similar, gestational age. Our data indicate that neocortex development in OSB fetuses is altered as early as 11 weeks of gestation. We observed a marked reduction in the radial thickness of the OSB neocortex, which appears to be attributable to a massive decrease in the number of deep- and upper-layer neurons per field, and found a marked reduction in the number of basal progenitors (BPs) per field in the OSB neocortex, consistent with an impairment of cortical neurogenesis underlying the neuronal decrease in OSB fetuses. Moreover, our data suggest that the decrease in BP number in the OSB neocortex may be associated with BPs spending a lesser proportion of their cell cycle in M-phase. Together, our findings expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of OSB and support the need for an early fetal therapy (i.e., in the first trimester of pregnancy).',\n",

Such conditioned stimuli (CS) can guide reward-seeking behavior in adaptive (e.g., locating food) and maladaptive (e.g., binge eating) ways. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) regulates conditioned responses evoked by appetitive CS, but less is known about how the BLA contributes to the instrumental pursuit of CS. Here we studied the influence of BLA neuron activity on both behavioral effects. Water-restricted male rats learned to associate a light-tone cue (CS) with water delivery into a port. During these Pavlovian conditioning sessions, we paired CS presentations with photo-stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing BLA neurons. BLA photo-stimulation potentiated CS-evoked port entries during conditioning, indicating enhanced conditioned approach and appetitive conditioning. Next, new rats received Pavlovian conditioning without photo-stimulation. These rats then received instrumental conditioning sessions where they could press an inactive lever or an active lever that produced CS presentation, without water delivery. Rats pressed more on the active versus inactive lever, and pairing CS presentation with BLA-ChR2 photo-stimulation intensified responding for the CS. This suggests that BLA-ChR2 photo-stimulation enhanced CS incentive value. In a separate experiment, rats did not reliably self-administer BLA-ChR2 stimulations, suggesting that BLA neurons do not carry a primary reward signal. Last, intra-BLA infusions of d-amphetamine also intensified lever-pressing for the CS. The findings suggest that BLA-mediated activity facilitates CS control over behavior by enhancing both appetitive Pavlovian conditioning and instrumental pursuit of CS.',\n",
       " 'The striatum is critical for controlling motor output. However, it remains unclear how striatal output neurons encode and facilitate movement. A prominent theory suggests that striatal units encode movements in bursts of activity near specific events, such as the start or end of actions. These bursts are theorized to gate or permit specific motor actions, thereby encoding and facilitating complex sequences of actions. An alternative theory has suggested that striatal neurons encode continuous changes in sensory or motor information with graded changes in firing rate. Supporting this theory, many striatal neurons exhibit such graded changes without bursting near specific actions. Here, we evaluated these two theories in the same recordings of mice (both male and female). We recorded single-unit and multiunit activity from the dorsomedial striatum of mice as they spontaneously explored an arena. We observed both types of encoding, although continuous encoding was more prevalent than bursting near movement initiation or termination. The majority of recorded units did not exhibit positive linear relationships with speed but instead exhibited nonlinear relationships that peaked at a range of locomotor speeds. Bulk calcium recordings of identified direct and indirect pathway neurons revealed similar speed tuning profiles, indicating that the heterogeneity in response profiles was not due to this genetic distinction. We conclude that continuous encoding of speed is a central component of movement encoding in the striatum.',\n",

       " \"Neurons in the visual system integrate over a wide range of spatial scales. This diversity is thought to enable both local and global computations. To understand how spatial information is encoded across the mouse visual system, we use two-photon imaging to measure receptive fields (RFs) and size-tuning in primary visual cortex (V1) and three downstream higher visual areas (HVAs: LM (lateromedial), AL (anterolateral), and PM (posteromedial)) in mice of both sexes. Neurons in PM, compared with V1 or the other HVAs, have significantly larger RF sizes and less surround suppression, independent of stimulus eccentricity or contrast. To understand how this specialization of RFs arises in the HVAs, we measured the spatial properties of V1 inputs to each area. Spatial integration of V1 axons was remarkably similar across areas and significantly different from the tuning of neurons in their target HVAs. Thus, unlike other visual features studied in this system, specialization of spatial integration in PM cannot be explained by specific projections from V1 to the HVAs. Further, the differences in RF properties could not be explained by differences in convergence of V1 inputs to the HVAs. Instead, our data suggest that distinct inputs from other areas or connectivity within PM may support the area's unique ability to encode global features of the visual scene, whereas V1, LM, and AL may be more specialized for processing local features.\",\n",
       " 'Severe loss of excitatory synapses in key brain regions is thought to be one of the major mechanisms underlying stress-induced cognitive impairment. To date, however, the identity of the affected circuits remains elusive. Here we examined the effect of exposure to repeated multiple concurrent stressors (RMS) on the connectivity of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in adolescent male mice. We found that RMS led to layer-specific elimination of excitatory synapses with the most pronounced loss observed in deeper cortical layers. Quantitative analysis of cortical projections to the PPC revealed a significant loss of sensory and retrosplenial inputs to the PPC while contralateral and frontal projections were preserved. These results were confirmed by decreased synaptic strength from sensory, but not from contralateral, projections in stress-exposed animals. Functionally, RMS disrupted visuospatial working memory performance, implicating disrupted higher-order visual processing. These effects were not observed in mice subjected to restraint-only stress for an identical period of time. The PPC is considered to be a cortical hub for multisensory integration, working memory, and perceptual decision-making. Our data suggest that sensory information streams targeting the PPC may be impacted by recurring stress, likely contributing to stress-induced cognitive impairment.',\n",

Some comparative studies link this to a larger frontal cortex and even larger frontal white matter in humans compared with other primates, yet others dispute these findings. The discrepancies between studies could be explained by limitations of the methods used to quantify volume differences across species, especially when applied to white matter connections. In this study, we used a novel tractography approach to demonstrate that frontal lobe networks, extending within and beyond the frontal lobes, occupy 66% of total brain white matter in humans and 48% in three monkey species: vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis), all male. The simian-human differences in proportional frontal tract volume were significant for projection, commissural, and both intralobar and interlobar association tracts. Among the long association tracts, the greatest difference was found for tracts involved in motor planning, auditory memory, top-down control of sensory information, and visuospatial attention, with no significant differences in frontal limbic tracts important for emotional processing and social behaviour. In addition, we found that a nonfrontal tract, the anterior commissure, had a smaller volume fraction in humans, suggesting that the disproportionally large volume of human frontal lobe connections is accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of some nonfrontal connections. These findings support a hypothesis of an overall rearrangement of brain connections during human evolution.',\n",
       " 'The development of sensory circuits is partially guided by sensory experience. In the medial superior olive (MSO), these refinements generate precise coincidence detection to localize sounds in the azimuthal plane. Glycinergic inhibitory inputs to the MSO, which tune the sensitivity to interaural time differences, undergo substantial structural and functional refinements after hearing onset. Whether excitation and calcium signaling in the MSO are similarly affected by the onset of acoustic experience is unresolved. To assess the time window and mechanism of excitatory and calcium-dependent refinements during late postnatal development, we quantified EPSCs and calcium entry in MSO neurons of Mongolian gerbils of either sex raised in a normal and in an activity altered, omnidirectional white noise environment. Global dendritic calcium transients elicited by action potentials disappeared rapidly after hearing onset. Local synaptic calcium transients decreased, leaving a GluR2 lacking AMPAR-mediated influx as the only activity-dependent source in adulthood. Exposure to omnidirectional white noise accelerated the decrease in calcium entry, leaving membrane properties unaffected. Thus, sound-driven activity accelerates the excitatory refinement and shortens the period of activity-dependent calcium signaling around hearing onset. Together with earlier reports, our findings highlight that excitation, inhibition, and biophysical properties are differentially sensitive to distinct features of sensory experience.',\n",

To learn how the MD-PFC thalamocortical network is engaged to mediate forms of cognitive control that are selectively disrupted in schizophrenia, we trained male monkeys to perform a variant of the AX continuous performance task, which reliably measures cognitive control deficits in patients (Henderson et al., 2012) and used linear multielectrode arrays to record neural activity in the MD and PFC simultaneously. We found that the two structures made clearly different contributions to distributed processing for cognitive control: MD neurons were specialized for decision-making and response selection, whereas prefrontal neurons were specialized to preferentially encode the environmental state on which the decision was based. In addition, we observed that functional coupling between MD and PFC was strongest when the decision as to which of the two responses in the task to execute was being made. These findings delineate unique contributions of MD and PFC to distributed processing for cognitive control and characterized neural dynamics in this network associated with normative cognitive control performance.',\n",
       " 'Neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and neuroinflammation are two prominent pathological features increasingly realized as important pathogenic mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases. However, little attempt has been taken to investigate the likely interactions between them. Mitofusin2 (Mfn2) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein regulating mitochondrial fusion, a dynamic process essential for mitochondrial function. To explore the significance of neuronal mitochondria in the regulation of neuroinflammation, male and female transgenic mice with forced overexpression of Mfn2 specifically in neurons were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a widely used approach to model neurodegeneration-associated neuroinflammation. Remarkably, LPS-induced lethality was almost completely abrogated in neuronal Mfn2 overexpression mice. Compared with nontransgenic wild-type mice, mice with neuronal Mfn2 overexpression also exhibited alleviated bodyweight loss, behavioral sickness, and myocardial dysfunction. LPS-induced release of IL-1β but not TNF-α was further found greatly inhibited in the CNS of mice with neuronal Mfn2 overexpression, whereas peripheral inflammatory responses in the blood, heart, lung, and spleen remained unchanged. At the cellular and molecular levels, neuronal Mfn2 suppressed the activation of microglia, prevented LPS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in neurons, and importantly, upregulated the expression of CX3CL1, a unique chemokine constitutively produced by neurons to suppress microglial activation. Together, these results reveal an unrecognized possible role of neuronal mitochondria in the regulation of microglial activation, and propose neuronal Mfn2 as a likely mechanistic linker between neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration.',\n",
       " \"For vocal communicators like humans and songbirds, survival and reproduction depend on highly developed auditory processing systems that can detect and differentiate nuanced differences in vocalizations, even amid noisy environments. Early auditory experience is critical to the development of these systems. In zebra finches and other songbirds, there is a sensitive period when young birds memorize a song that will serve as a model for their own vocal production. In addition to learning a specific tutor's song, the auditory system may also undergo critical developmental processes that support auditory perception of vocalizations more generally. Here, we investigate changes in intrinsic spiking dynamics among neurons in the caudal mesopallium, a cortical-level auditory area implicated in discriminating and learning species-specific vocalizations. A subset of neurons in this area only fire transiently at the onset of current injections (i.e., phasic firing), a dynamical property that can enhance the reliability and selectivity of neural responses to complex acoustic stimuli. At the beginning of the sensitive period, just after zebra finches have fledged from the nest, there is an increase in the proportion of caudal mesopallium neurons with phasic excitability, and in the proportion of neurons expressing Kv1.1, a low-threshold channel that facilitates phasic firing. This plasticity requires exposure to a complex, noisy environment and is greater in males, the only sex that sings in this species. This shift to more phasic dynamics is therefore an experience-dependent adaptation that could facilitate auditory processing in noisy, acoustically complex conditions during a key stage of vocal development.\",\n",
       " 'Natural scenes often contain multiple objects and surfaces. However, how neurons in the visual cortex represent multiple visual stimuli is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that, when multiple stimuli compete in one feature domain, the evoked neuronal response is biased toward the stimulus that has a stronger signal strength. We recorded from two male macaques to investigate how neurons in the middle temporal cortex (MT) represent multiple stimuli that compete in more than one feature domain. Visual stimuli were two random-dot patches moving in different directions. One stimulus had low luminance contrast and moved with high coherence, whereas the other had high contrast and moved with low coherence. We found that how MT neurons represent multiple stimuli depended on the spatial arrangement. When two stimuli were overlapping, MT responses were dominated by the stimulus component that had high contrast. When two stimuli were spatially separated within the receptive fields, the contrast dominance was abolished. We found the same results when using contrast to compete with motion speed. Our neural data and computer simulations using a V1-MT model suggest that the contrast dominance found with overlapping stimuli is due to normalization occurring at an input stage fed to MT, and MT neurons cannot overturn this bias based on their own feature selectivity. The interaction between spatially separated stimuli can largely be explained by normalization within MT. Our results revealed new rules on stimulus competition and highlighted the impact of hierarchical processing on representing multiple stimuli in the visual cortex.',\n",

We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of multisensory integration for motor adaptation by evaluating single-trial adaptation (i.e., aftereffect) induced by visual and proprioceptive perturbations while male and female human participants performed reaching movements. The force-channel method was used to precisely impose several combinations of visual and proprioceptive perturbations (i.e., error), including an instance when the directions of perturbation in both stimuli opposed each another. In the subsequent probe force-channel trial, the lateral force against the channel was quantified as the aftereffect to clarify the mechanism by which the motor adaptation system corrects movement in the event of visual and proprioceptive errors. We observed that the aftereffects had complex dependence on the visual and proprioceptive errors. Although this pattern could not be explained by previously proposed computational models based on the reliability of sensory information, we found that it could be reasonably explained by a mechanism known as divisive normalization, which was the reported mechanism underlying the integration of multisensory signals in neurons. Furthermore, we discovered evidence that the motor memory for each sensory modality developed separately in accordance with a divisive normalization mechanism and that the outputs of both memories were integrated. These results provide a novel view of the utilization and integration of different sensory modality signals in motor adaptation.',\n",

Here we test in human adults whether small variations in the timing of movement relative to beta bursts have a critical effect on movement velocity and whether the cumulative effects of multiple beta bursts, both locally and across networks, matter. We recorded local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in 15 PD patients of both genders OFF-medication, during temporary lead externalization after deep brain stimulation surgery. Beta bursts were defined as periods exceeding the 75th percentile amplitude threshold. Subjects performed a visual cued joystick reaching task, with the visual cue being triggered in real time with different temporal relationships to bursts of STN beta activity. The velocity of actions made in response to cues prospectively triggered by STN beta bursts was slower than when responses were not time-locked to recent beta bursts. Importantly, slow movements were those that followed multiple bursts close to each other within a trial. In contrast, small differences in the delay between the last burst and movement onset had no significant impact on velocity. Moreover, when the overlap of bursts between the two STN was high, slowing was more pronounced. Our findings suggest that the cumulative, but recent, history of beta bursting, both locally and across basal ganglia networks, may impact on motor performance.\",\n",

Familial forms of AD are tied to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, but the cellular mechanisms that cause AD remain unclear. Inflammation and amyloidosis from amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates are implicated in neuron loss and cognitive decline. Inflammation activates the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and this could suppress many signaling pathways that activate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) implicated in neurodegeneration. However, the significance of PTP1B in AD pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B with trodusquemine or selective ablation of PTP1B in neurons prevents hippocampal neuron loss and spatial memory deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model with Aβ pathology (hAPP-J20 mice of both sexes). Intriguingly, while systemic inhibition of PTP1B reduced inflammation in the hippocampus, neuronal PTP1B ablation did not. These results dissociate inflammation from neuronal loss and cognitive decline and demonstrate that neuronal PTP1B hastens neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in this model of AD. The protective effect of PTP1B inhibition or ablation coincides with the restoration of GSK3β inhibition. Neuronal ablation of PTP1B did not affect cerebral amyloid levels or plaque numbers, but reduced Aβ plaque size in the hippocampus.

       " 'Understanding the contribution of neuropeptide-containing neurons to variation in social behavior remains critically important. Galanin has gained increased attention because of the demonstration that galanin neurons in the preoptic area (POA) promote mating and parental care in mammals. How widespread these mechanisms are among vertebrates essentially remains unexplored, especially among teleost fishes, which comprise nearly one-half of living vertebrate species. Teleosts with alternative reproductive tactics exhibit stereotyped patterns of social behavior that diverge widely between individuals within a sex. This includes midshipman that have two male morphs. Type I males mate using either acoustic courtship to attract females to enter a nest they guard or cuckoldry during which they steal fertilizations from a nest-holding male using a sneak or satellite spawning tactic, whereas type II males only cuckold. Using the neural activity marker phospho-S6, we show increased galanin neuron activation in courting type I males during mating that is not explained by their courtship vocalizations, parental care of eggs, or nest defense against cuckolders. This increase is not observed during mating in cuckolders of either morph or females (none of which show parental care). Together with their role in mating in male mammals, the results demonstrate an unexpectedly specific and deep-rooted, phylogenetically shared behavioral function for POA galanin neurons. The results also point to galanin-dependent circuitry as a potential substrate for the evolution of divergent phenotypes within one sex and provide new functional insights into how POA populations in teleosts compare to the POA and anterior hypothalamus of tetrapods.',\n",
       " 'Myelin loss limits neurological recovery and myelin regeneration and is critical for restoration of function. We recently discovered that global knock-out of the thrombin receptor, also known as Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1), accelerates myelin development. Here we demonstrate that knocking out PAR1 also promotes myelin regeneration. Outcomes in two unique models of myelin injury and repair, that is lysolecithin or cuprizone-mediated demyelination, showed that PAR1 knock-out in male mice improves replenishment of myelinating cells and remyelinated nerve fibers and slows early axon damage. Improvements in myelin regeneration in PAR1 knock-out mice occurred in tandem with a skewing of reactive astrocyte signatures toward a prorepair phenotype. In cell culture, the promyelinating effects of PAR1 loss of function are consistent with possible direct effects on the myelinating potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), in addition to OPC-indirect effects involving enhanced astrocyte expression of promyelinating factors, such as BDNF. These findings highlight previously unrecognized roles of PAR1 in myelin regeneration, including integrated actions across the oligodendrocyte and astroglial compartments that are at least partially mechanistically linked to the powerful BDNF-TrkB neurotrophic signaling system.

       " \"The ongoing activity of prefrontal neurons after a stimulus has disappeared is considered a neuronal correlate of working memory. It depends on the delicate but poorly understood interplay between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic receptor effects. We administered the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide while recording cellular activity in PFC of male rhesus monkeys performing a delayed decision task requiring working memory. The blockade of GABA(A) receptors strongly improved the selectivity of the neurons' delay activity, causing an increase in signal-to-noise ratio during working memory periods as well as an enhancement of the neurons' coding selectivity. The blockade of NMDA receptors resulted in a slight enhancement of selectivity and encoding capacity of the neurons. Our findings emphasize the delicate and more complex than expected interplay of excitatory and inhibitory transmitter systems in modulating working memory coding in prefrontal circuits.\",\n",

Here, we propose that phagocytosis is not merely passive corpse removal but has an active role in maintaining neurogenesis. First, we found that neurogenesis was disrupted in male and female mice chronically deficient for two phagocytosis pathways: the purinergic receptor P2Y12, and the tyrosine kinases of the TAM family Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK)/Axl. In contrast, neurogenesis was transiently increased in mice in which MerTK expression was conditionally downregulated.

Predictions can be sourced from higher-order cognitive processes, such as schemas, but the extent to which schemas can influence pain perception relative to bottom-up sensory inputs and the underlying neural underpinnings of such a phenomenon are unclear. Here, we investigate how threat predictions generated from learning a cognitive schema lead to inaccurate sensory impressions of the pain stimulus. Healthy male and female participants first detected a linear association between cue values and stimulus intensity and rated pain to reflect the linear schema when compared with uncued heat stimuli. The effect of bias on pain ratings was reduced when prediction errors (PEs) increased, but pain perception was only partially updated when measured against stepped increases in PEs. Cognitive, striatal, and sensory regions graded their responses to changes in predicted threat despite the PEs (',\n",

However, little data exist on motility of human microglia in pathological situations. Here we examine motility of microglia stained with a fluorescent lectin in tissue slices from female and male epileptic patients diagnosed with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy or cortical glioma (peritumoral cortex). Microglial shape varied from ramified to amoeboid cells predominantly in regions of high neuronal loss or closer to a tumor. Live imaging revealed unstimulated or purine-induced microglial motilities, including surveillance movements, membrane ruffling, and process extension or retraction. At different concentrations, ADP triggered opposing motilities. Low doses triggered process extension. It was suppressed by P2Y12 receptor antagonists, which also reduced process length and surveillance movements. Higher purine doses caused process retraction and membrane ruffling, which were blocked by joint application of P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptor antagonists. Purinergic effects on motility were similar for all microglia tested. Both amoeboid and ramified cells from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy or peritumoral cortex tissue expressed P2Y12 receptors. A minority of microglia expressed the adenosine A2A receptor, which has been linked with process withdrawal of rodent cells. Laser-mediated tissue damage let us test the functional significance of these effects. Moderate damage induced microglial process extension, which was blocked by P2Y12 receptor antagonists. Overall, the purine-induced motility of human microglia in epileptic tissue is similar to that of rodent microglia in that the P2Y12 receptor initiates process extension. It differs in that retraction is triggered by joint activation of P2Y1/P2Y13 receptors.',\n",

Although neural maturation in humans can be measured using functional and structural MRI, the subtle patterns associated with the initial stages of abnormal change may be difficult to identify, particularly at an individual level. Brain age prediction models may have utility in assessing brain development in an individualized manner, as deviations between chronological age and predicted brain age could reflect one's divergence from typical development. Here, we built a support vector regression model to summarize high-dimensional neuroimaging as an index of brain age in both sexes. Using structural and functional MRI data from two large pediatric datasets and a third clinical dataset, we produced and validated a two-dimensional neural maturation index (NMI) that characterizes typical brain maturation patterns and identifies those who deviate from this trajectory. Examination of brain signatures associated with NMI scores revealed that elevated scores were related to significantly lower gray matter volume and significantly higher white matter volume, particularly in high-order regions such as the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, those with higher NMI scores exhibited enhanced connectivity in several functional brain networks, including the default mode network. Analysis of data from a sample of male and female patients with schizophrenia revealed an association between advanced NMI scores and schizophrenia diagnosis in participants aged 16-22, confirming the NMI's utility as a marker of atypicality. Altogether, our findings support the NMI as an individualized, interpretable measure by which neural development in adolescence may be assessed.\",\n",

Heterotypic coupling was further confirmed via tracer spread after intracellular injections of single cells with neurobiotin. Both electrically coupled cell types were sustained ON center ganglion cells but showed distinct light response properties and receptive field sizes. We identified one of the involved cell types as sustained ON α-ganglion cells.

Rather than consider stress biology to be relevant only under unusual and threatening conditions, we conceive of it as an ongoing, adaptive process of assessing the environment, coping with it, and enabling the individual to anticipate and deal with future challenges. Though much remains to be discovered, the fundamental neurocircuitry that underlies these processes has been broadly delineated, key molecular players have been identified, and the impact of this system on neuroplasticity has been well established. More recently, we have come to appreciate the critical interaction between the brain and the rest of the body as it pertains to stress responsiveness. Importantly, this system can become overloaded due to ongoing environmental demands on the individual, be they physical, physiological, or psychosocial. The impact of this overload is deleterious to brain health, and it results in vulnerability to a range of brain disorders, including major depression and cognitive deficits. Thus, stress biology is one of the best understood systems in affective neuroscience and is an ideal target for addressing the pathophysiology of many brain-related diseases. The story we present began with the discovery of glucocorticoid receptors in hippocampus and has extended to other brain regions in both animal models and the human brain with the further discovery of structural and functional adaptive plasticity in response to stressful and other experiences.',\n",

Lip-reading in silence activates the auditory cortices, but it is not known whether such activation reflects immediate synthesis of the corresponding auditory stimulus or imagery of unrelated sounds. To disentangle these possibilities, we used magnetoencephalography to evaluate how cortical activity in 28 healthy adult humans (17 females) entrained to the auditory speech envelope and lip movements (mouth opening) when listening to a spoken story without visual input (audio-only), and when seeing a silent video of a speaker articulating another story (video-only). In video-only, auditory cortical activity entrained to the absent auditory signal at frequencies <1 Hz more than to the seen lip movements. This entrainment process was characterized by an auditory-speech-to-brain delay of ∼70 ms in the left hemisphere, compared with ∼20 ms in audio-only. Entrainment to mouth opening was found in the right angular gyrus at <1 Hz, and in early visual cortices at 1-8 Hz. These findings demonstrate that the brain can use a silent lip-read signal to synthesize a coarse-grained auditory speech representation in early auditory cortices. Our data indicate the following underlying oscillatory mechanism: seeing lip movements first modulates neuronal activity in early visual cortices at frequencies that match articulatory lip movements; the right angular gyrus then extracts slower features of lip movements, mapping them onto the corresponding speech sound features; this information is fed to auditory cortices, most likely facilitating speech parsing.',\n",

       " 'Many neurodegenerative and neurological diseases are rooted in dysfunction of the neuroimmune system; therefore, manipulating this system has strong therapeutic potential. Prior work has shown that exposing mice to flickering lights at 40 Hz drives gamma frequency (∼40 Hz) neural activity and recruits microglia, the primary immune cells of the brain, revealing a novel method to manipulate the neuroimmune system. However, the biochemical signaling mechanisms between 40 Hz neural activity and immune recruitment remain unknown. Here, we exposed wild-type male mice to 5-60 min of 40 Hz or control flicker and assessed cytokine and phosphoprotein networks known to play a role in immune function. We found that 40 Hz flicker leads to increases in the expression of cytokines which promote microglial phagocytic states, such as IL-6 and IL-4, and increased expression of microglial chemokines, such as macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and monokine induced by interferon-γ. Interestingly, cytokine effects differed as a function of stimulation frequency, revealing a range of neuroimmune effects of stimulation. To identify possible mechanisms underlying cytokine expression, we quantified the effect of the flicker on intracellular signaling pathways known to regulate cytokine levels. We found that a 40 Hz flicker upregulates phospho-signaling within the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. While cytokine expression increased after 1 h of 40 Hz flicker stimulation, protein phosphorylation in the NF-κB pathway was upregulated within minutes. Importantly, the cytokine expression profile induced by 40 Hz flicker was different from cytokine changes in response to acute neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides.

       " 'An abundant literature has highlighted the importance of the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) in behavioral tasks dependent on external stimuli. Yet, some studies have also reported the absence of involvement of the NAcC in stimuli processing. We aimed at comparing, in male rats, the underlying neuronal determinants of incentive and instructive stimuli in the same task. We developed a variant of a GO/NOGO task that reveals important differences in these two types of stimuli. The incentive stimulus invites the rat to engage in the task sequence. Once the rat has decided to initiate a trial, it remains engaged in the task until the end of the trial. This task revealed the differential contribution of the NAcC to responding to different types of stimuli: responding to the incentive stimulus depended on NAcC AMPA/NMDA and dopamine D1 receptors, but the retrieval of the response associated with the instructive stimuli (lever pressing on GO, withholding on NOGO) did not. Our electrophysiological study showed that more NAcC neurons responded more strongly to the incentive than the instructive stimuli. Furthermore, when animals did not respond to the incentive stimulus, the induced excitation was suppressed for most projection neurons, whereas interneurons were strongly activated at a latency preceding that found in projection neurons. This work provides insight on the underlying neuronal processes explaining the preferential implication of the NAcC in deciding whether and when to engage in reward-seeking rather than to decide which action to perform.',\n",
       " \"Categorization allows organisms to generalize existing knowledge to novel stimuli and to discriminate between physically similar yet conceptually different stimuli. Humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents can readily learn arbitrary categories defined by low-level visual features, and learning distorts perceptual sensitivity for category-defining features such that differences between physically similar yet categorically distinct exemplars are enhanced, whereas differences between equally similar but categorically identical stimuli are reduced. We report a possible basis for these distortions in human occipitoparietal cortex. In three experiments, we used an inverted encoding model to recover population-level representations of stimuli from multivoxel and multielectrode patterns of human brain activity while human participants (both sexes) classified continuous stimulus sets into discrete groups. In each experiment, reconstructed representations of to-be-categorized stimuli were systematically biased toward the center of the appropriate category. These biases were largest for exemplars near a category boundary, predicted participants' overt category judgments, emerged shortly after stimulus onset, and could not be explained by mechanisms of response selection or motor preparation. Collectively, our findings suggest that category learning can influence processing at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing.\",\n",
       " 'Interfering with memory reconsolidation or inducing memory extinction are two approaches for weakening maladaptive memories in disorders such as addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Both extinction and reconsolidation are regulated by intracellular protein kinases and phosphatases, and interfering with these signaling molecules can alter memory strength. The calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN), has been implicated in both the consolidation and extinction of fear memories. However, the role of CaN in regulating drug-cue associative memories has not been investigated. Prior studies have demonstrated that plasticity at thalamo-lateral amygdala (T-LA) synapses is critically involved in the regulation of cocaine-cue memories. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the effects of LA administration of an activator of CaN, chlorogenic acid (CGA), on behavioral and electrophysiological indices of cocaine cue memory reconsolidation and extinction. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine paired with an audiovisual cue. The cue memory was then either briefly reactivated, extinguished, or not manipulated, followed immediately by LA infusion of CGA. Rats were tested 24 h later for cue-induced reinstatement, or LA slices were prepared for electrophysiological recordings. We found that intra-LA infusions of CGA following cue extinction or reconsolidation reduced cue-induced reinstatement, which was blocked by co-infusion of the CaN inhibitor, FK-506. Similarly, CGA infusions following cue re-exposure significantly attenuated EPSC amplitude at T-LA synapses, suggesting that CaN affects cocaine-cue memory reconsolidation and extinction by altering T-LA synaptic strength. Therefore, CaN signaling in the LA may represent a novel target for disrupting cocaine-associated memories to reduce relapse.',\n",

Recent imaging studies in rodents have identified a \"gustotopic\" organization in the insula, whereby distinct insula regions are selectively responsive to one of the five basic tastes. However, numerous studies in monkeys have reported that gustatory cortical neurons are broadly-tuned to multiple tastes, and tastes are not represented in discrete spatial locations. Neuroimaging studies in humans have thus far been unable to discern between these two models, though this may be because of the relatively low spatial resolution used in taste studies to date. In the present study, we examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain using ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high magnetic field strength (7-tesla). During scanning, male and female participants tasted sweet, salty, sour, and tasteless liquids, delivered via a custom-built MRI-compatible tastant-delivery system. Our univariate analyses revealed that all tastes (vs tasteless) activated primary taste cortex within the bilateral dorsal mid-insula, but no brain region exhibited a consistent preference for any individual taste. However, our multivariate searchlight analyses were able to reliably decode the identity of distinct tastes within those mid-insula regions, as well as brain regions involved in affect and reward, such as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala. These results suggest that taste quality is not represented topographically, but by a distributed population code, both within primary taste cortex as well as regions involved in processing the hedonic and aversive properties of taste.',\n",

Although its role in psychiatric disorders is widely acknowledged, the understanding of its circuitry is not complete. Here, we combined optogenetic and whole-cell recordings to draw a functional portrait of excitatory disambiguated synapses onto D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the adult male mouse NAc core. Comparing synaptic properties of ventral hippocampus (vHipp), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) inputs revealed a hierarchy of synaptic inputs that depends on the identity of the postsynaptic target MSN. Thus, the BLA is the dominant excitatory pathway onto D1 MSNs (BLA > PFC = vHipp) while PFC inputs dominate D2 MSNs (PFC > vHipp > BLA). We also tested the hypothesis that endocannabinoids endow excitatory circuits with pathway- and cell-specific plasticity. Thus, whereas CB1 receptors (CB1R) uniformly depress excitatory pathways regardless of MSNs identity, TRPV1 receptors (TRPV1R) bidirectionally control inputs onto the NAc core in a pathway-specific manner. Finally, we show that the interplay of TRPV1R/CB1R shapes plasticity at BLA-NAc synapses. Together these data shed new light on synapse and circuit specificity in the adult NAc core and illustrate how endocannabinoids contribute to pathway-specific synaptic plasticity.',\n",

       " 'The hallmark of episodic memory is recollecting multiple perceptual details tied to a specific spatial-temporal context. To remember an event, it is therefore necessary to integrate such details into a coherent representation during initial encoding. Here we tested how the brain encodes and binds multiple, distinct kinds of features in parallel, and how this process evolves over time during the event itself. We analyzed data from 27 human subjects (16 females, 11 males) who learned a series of objects uniquely associated with a color, a panoramic scene location, and an emotional sound while fMRI data were collected. By modeling how brain activity relates to memory for upcoming or just-viewed information, we were able to test how the neural signatures of individual features as well as the integrated event changed over the course of encoding. We observed a striking dissociation between early and late encoding processes: left inferior frontal and visuo-perceptual signals at the onset of an event tracked the amount of detail subsequently recalled and were dissociable based on distinct remembered features. In contrast, memory-related brain activity shifted to the left hippocampus toward the end of an event, which was particularly sensitive to binding item color and sound associations with spatial information. These results provide evidence of early, simultaneous feature-specific neural responses during episodic encoding that predict later remembering and suggest that the hippocampus integrates these features into a coherent experience at an event transition.',\n",

Memory impairments are characterized by accelerated decay of spatial memories. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of the growth arrest DNA damage (Gadd45) family during aging and cognition, respectively. We report that aging impairs the expression of Gadd45γ in the hippocampus of cognitively impaired male mice. Mimicking this decrease in young adult male mice led to age-like memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Gadd45γ reduction impaired the activity of key components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (p38 and JNK) in mouse hippocampal cultures. Furthermore, we found that activation of downstream targets, such as ATF-2, c-Jun, and CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), was disrupted. Finally, we showed that Gadd45γ is required for induction of key early- and late-response genes that have been associated with aging. Together, these findings indicate that Gadd45γ expression regulates cognitive abilities and synapse-to-nucleus communication and suggest Gadd45γ dysfunction as a potential mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive impairments.',\n",
       " 'When moving around in the world, the human visual system uses both motion and form information to estimate the direction of self-motion (i.e., heading). However, little is known about cortical areas in charge of this task. This brain-imaging study addressed this question by using visual stimuli consisting of randomly distributed dot pairs oriented toward a locus on a screen (the form-defined focus of expansion [FoE]) but moved away from a different locus (the motion-defined FoE) to simulate observer translation. We first fixed the motion-defined FoE location and shifted the form-defined FoE location. We then made the locations of the motion- and the form-defined FoEs either congruent (at the same location in the display) or incongruent (on the opposite sides of the display). The motion- or the form-defined FoE shift was the same in the two types of stimuli, but the perceived heading direction shifted for the congruent, but not for the incongruent stimuli. Participants (both sexes) made a task-irrelevant (contrast discrimination) judgment during scanning. Searchlight and ROI-based multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that early visual areas V1, V2, and V3 responded to either the motion- or the form-defined FoE shift. After V3, only the dorsal areas V3a and V3B/KO responded to such shifts. Furthermore, area V3B/KO shows a significantly higher decoding accuracy for the congruent than the incongruent stimuli. Our results provide direct evidence showing that area V3B/KO does not simply respond to motion and form cues but integrates these two cues for the perception of heading.',\n",
       " \"Vocal communication relies on the ability of listeners to identify, process, and respond to vocal sounds produced by others in complex environments. To accurately recognize these signals, animals' auditory systems must robustly represent acoustic features that distinguish vocal sounds from other environmental sounds. Vocalizations typically have spectral structure; power regularly fluctuates along the frequency axis, creating spectral contrast. Spectral contrast is closely related to harmonicity, which refers to spectral power peaks occurring at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. Although both spectral contrast and harmonicity typify natural sounds, they may differ in salience for communication behavior and engage distinct neural mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to understand which of these properties of vocal sounds underlie the neural processing and perception of vocalizations.Here, we test the importance of vocalization-typical spectral features in behavioral recognition and neural processing of vocal sounds, using male zebra finches. We show that behavioral responses to natural and synthesized vocalizations rely on the presence of discrete frequency components, but not on harmonic ratios between frequencies. We identify a specific population of neurons in primary auditory cortex that are sensitive to the spectral resolution of vocal sounds. We find that behavioral and neural response selectivity is explained by sensitivity to spectral contrast rather than harmonicity. This selectivity emerges within the cortex; it is absent in the thalamorecipient region and present in the deep output region. Further, deep-region neurons that are contrast-sensitive show distinct temporal responses and selectivity for modulation density compared with unselective neurons.\",\n",

Healthy aging has been shown to independently affect both of these functions. Here, we investigate how reinforcement learning and selective attention interact during learning from trial and error across age groups. We acquired behavioral and fMRI data from older and younger adults (male and female) performing two probabilistic learning tasks with varying attention demands. Although learning in the unidimensional task did not differ across age groups, older adults performed worse than younger adults in the multidimensional task, which required high levels of selective attention. Computational modeling showed that choices of older adults are better predicted by reinforcement learning than Bayesian inference, and that older adults rely more on reinforcement learning-based predictions than younger adults. Conversely, a higher proportion of younger adults' choices was predicted by a computationally demanding Bayesian approach. In line with the behavioral findings, we observed no group differences in reinforcement-learning related fMRI activation. Specifically, prediction-error activation in the nucleus accumbens was similar across age groups, and numerically higher in older adults. However, activation in the default mode was less suppressed in older adults in for higher attentional task demands, and the level of suppression correlated with behavioral performance. Our results indicate that healthy aging does not significantly impair simple reinforcement learning. However, in complex environments, older adults rely more heavily on suboptimal reinforcement-learning strategies supported by the ventral striatum, whereas younger adults use attention processes supported by cortical networks.\",\n",

Our previous studies have shown that Sim1-expressing V3 INs, originating from the p3 progenitor domain, are anatomically and physiologically divergent. However, the developmental logic guiding V3 subpopulation diversity remains elusive. In specific cases of other IN classes, neurogenesis timing can play a role in determining the ultimate fates and unique characteristics of distinctive subpopulations. To examine whether neurogenesis timing contributes to V3 diversity, we systematically investigated the temporal neurogenesis profiles of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord. Our work uncovered that V3 INs were organized into either early-born [embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E10.5] or late-born (E11.5-E12.5) neurogenic waves. Early-born V3 INs displayed both ascending and descending commissural projections and clustered into subgroups across dorsoventral spinal laminae. In contrast, late-born V3 INs became fate-restricted to ventral laminae and displayed mostly descending and local commissural projections and uniform membrane properties. Furthermore, we found that the postmitotic transcription factor, Sim1, although expressed in all V3 INs, exclusively regulated the dorsal clustering and electrophysiological diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs, which indicates that neurogenesis timing may enable newborn V3 INs to interact with different postmitotic differentiation pathways. Thus, our work demonstrates neurogenesis timing as a developmental mechanism underlying the postmitotic differentiation of V3 INs into distinct subpopulation assemblies.',\n",
       " \"Neurofibrillary tangles likely cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrate that the CX3CL1 C-terminal domain can upregulate neurogenesis, which may ameliorate neurodegeneration. Here we generated transgenic (Tg-CX3CL1) mice by overexpressing CX3CL1 in neurons. Tg-CX3CL1 mice exhibit enhanced neurogenesis in both subgranular and subventricular zones. This enhanced neurogenesis correlates well with elevated expression of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3, and activation of their downstream signaling molecule Smad2. Intriguingly, the enhanced adult neurogenesis was mitigated when Smad2 expression was deleted in neurons, supporting a role for the CX3CL1-TGF-β2/3-Smad2 pathway in the control of adult neurogenesis. When Tg-CX3CL1 mice were crossed with Alzheimer's PS19 mice, which overexpress a tau P301S mutation and exhibit age-dependent neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, overexpressed CX3CL1 in both male and female mice was sufficient to rescue the neurodegeneration, increase survival time, and improve cognitive function.

       " 'Differently from other myeloid cells, microglia derive exclusively from precursors originating within the yolk sac and migrate to the CNS under development, without any contribution from fetal liver or postnatal hematopoiesis. Consistent with their unique ontology, microglia may express specific physiological markers, which have been partly described in recent years. Here we wondered whether profiles distinguishing microglia from peripheral macrophages vary with age and under pathology. To this goal, we profiled transcriptomes of microglia throughout the lifespan and included a parallel comparison with peripheral macrophages under physiological and neuroinflammatory settings using age- and sex-matched wild-type and bone marrow chimera mouse models. This comprehensive approach demonstrated that the phenotypic differentiation between microglia and peripheral macrophages is age-dependent and that peripheral macrophages do express some of the most commonly described microglia-specific markers early during development, such as Fcrls, P2ry12, Tmem119, and Trem2. Further, during chronic neuroinflammation CNS-infiltrating macrophages and not peripheral myeloid cells acquire microglial markers, indicating that the CNS niche may instruct peripheral myeloid cells to gain the phenotype and, presumably, the function of the microglia cell. In conclusion, our data provide further evidence about the plasticity of the myeloid cell and suggest caution in the strict definition and application of microglia-specific markers.',\n",
       " 'Previous studies in human subjects reported that the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), a core area of the vestibular cortex, is inhibited when visual processing is prioritized. However, it has remained unclear which networks in the brain modulate this inhibition of PIVC. Based on previous results showing that the inhibition of PIVC is strongly influenced by visual attention, we here examined whether attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate the inhibition of PIVC. Using diffusion-weighted and resting-state fMRI in a group of female and male subjects, we found structural and functional connections between PIVC and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a major brain region of the cortical attention network. We then temporarily inhibited PPC by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and hypothesized that the modulatory influence of PPC over PIVC would be reduced; and, as a result, PIVC would be less inhibited. Subjects performed a visual attentional tracking task immediately after rTMS, and the inhibition of PIVC during attentive tracking was measured with fMRI. The results showed that the inhibition of PIVC during attentive tracking was less pronounced compared with sham rTMS. We also examined the effects of inhibitory rTMS over the occipital cortex and found that the visual-vestibular posterior insular cortex area was less activated during attentive tracking compared with sham rTMS or rTMS over PPC. Together, these results suggest that attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate activity in core areas of the vestibular cortex during attentive visual processing.',\n",

Here, we show that selective block of Panx1 in single postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons from male rat or mouse brain slices causes intermittent, seconds long increases in the frequency of sEPSC following Schaffer collateral stimulation. The increase in sEPSC frequency occurred without an effect on evoked neurotransmission. Consistent with a presynaptic origin of the augmented glutamate release, the increased sEPSC frequency was prevented by bath-applied EGTA-AM or TTX. Manipulation of a previously described metabotropic NMDAR pathway (i.e., by preventing ligand binding to NMDARs with competitive antagonists or blocking downstream Src kinase) also increased sEPSC frequency similar to that seen when Panx1 was blocked. This facilitated glutamate release was absent in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) KO mice and prevented by the TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine, suggesting it required presynaptic TRPV1. We show presynaptic expression of TRPV1 by immunoelectron microscopy and link TRPV1 to Panx1 because Panx1 block increases tissue levels of the endovanilloid, anandamide. Together, these findings demonstrate an unexpected role for metabotropic NMDARs and postsynaptic Panx1 in suppression of facilitated glutamate neurotransmission.',\n",

       " 'Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense and less ticklish than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with fMRI to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.',\n",

A signature of the relationship between vision and sociality is a particular visual sensitivity to social entities such as faces and bodies. We asked whether human vision also exhibits a special sensitivity to spatial relations that reliably correlate with social relations. In general, interacting people are more often situated face-to-face than back-to-back. Using functional MRI and behavioral measures in female and male human participants, we show that visual sensitivity to social stimuli extends to images including two bodies facing toward (vs away from) each other. In particular, the inferior lateral occipital cortex, which is involved in visual-object perception, is organized such that the inferior portion encodes the number of bodies (one vs two) and the superior portion is selectively sensitive to the spatial relation between bodies (facing vs nonfacing). Moreover, functionally localized, body-selective visual cortex responded to facing bodies more strongly than identical, but nonfacing, bodies. In this area, multivariate pattern analysis revealed an accurate representation of body dyads with sharpening of the representation of single-body postures in facing dyads, which demonstrates an effect of visual context on the perceptual analysis of a body. Finally, the cost of body inversion (upside-down rotation) on body recognition, a behavioral signature of a specialized mechanism for body perception, was larger for facing versus nonfacing dyads. Thus, spatial relations between multiple bodies are encoded in regions for body perception and affect the way in which bodies are processed.',\n",

Here, we asked whether C1q plays a role in experience-dependent synaptic refinement in the visual system at later stages of development. The binocular zone of primary visual cortex (V1b) undergoes spine loss and changes in neuronal responsiveness following the closure of one eye during a defined critical period [a process referred to as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP)]. We therefore hypothesized that ODP would be impaired in the absence of C1q, and that V1b development would also be abnormal without C1q-mediated synapse elimination. However, when we examined several features of V1b development in mice lacking C1q, we found that the densities of most spine populations on basal and proximal apical dendrites, as well as firing rates and ocular dominance, were normal. C1q was only transiently required for the development of spines on apical, but not basal, secondary dendrites. Dendritic morphologies were also unaffected. Although we did not observe the previously described spine loss during ODP in either genotype, our results reveal that the animals lacking C1q had normal shifts in neuronal responsiveness following eye closure. Experiments were performed in both male and female mice. These results suggest that the development and plasticity of the mouse V1b is grossly normal in the absence of C1q.',\n",

       " 'Stress impairs extinction learning, and these deficits depend, in part, on stress-induced norepinephrine (NE) release in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). For example, systemic or intra-BLA administration of propranolol reduces the immediate extinction deficit (IED), an impairment in extinction learning that occurs when extinction trials are administered soon after fear conditioning. Here, we explored whether locus coeruleus (LC)-NE regulates stress-induced changes in spike firing in the BLA and consequent extinction learning impairments. Rats were implanted with recording arrays in the BLA and, after recovery from surgery, underwent a standard auditory fear conditioning procedure. Fear conditioning produced an immediate and dramatic increase in the spontaneous firing of BLA neurons that persisted (and in some units, increased further) up to an hour after conditioning. This stress-induced increase in BLA firing was prevented by systemic administration of propranolol. Conditioning with a weaker footshock caused smaller increases in BLA firing rate, but this could be augmented by chemogenetic activation of the LC. Conditioned freezing in response to a tone paired with a weak footshock was immune to the IED, but chemogenetic activation of the LC before the weak conditioning protocol increased conditioned freezing behavior and induced an IED; this effect was blocked with intra-BLA infusions of propranolol. These data suggest that stress-induced activation of the LC increases BLA spike firing and causes impairments in extinction learning. Stress-induced increases in BLA activity mediated by LC-NE may be a viable therapeutic target for individuals with stress- and trauma-related disorders.',\n",

Contour perception is essential to this process and can occur despite breaks in the continuity of neighboring features. Such robustness of the animal visual system to degraded or occluded shapes may also give rise to an interesting phenomenon of optical illusions. These illusions provide a great opportunity to decipher neural computations underlying contour integration and object detection.

Empirical studies found that sensory stimulation during SWS can selectively enhance memory consolidation with the effect depending on the phase of stimulation. In this new study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms behind the role of sensory stimulation on memory consolidation using computational models implementing effects of neuromodulators to simulate transitions between awake and SWS sleep, and synaptic plasticity to allow the change of synaptic connections due to the training in awake or replay during sleep. We found that when closed-loop stimulation was applied during the Down states of sleep slow oscillation, particularly right before the transition from Down to Up state, it significantly affected the spatiotemporal pattern of the slow waves and maximized memory replay. In contrast, when the stimulation was presented during the Up states, it did not have a significant impact on the slow waves or memory performance after sleep. For multiple memories trained in awake, presenting stimulation cues associated with specific memory trace could selectively augment replay and enhance consolidation of that memory and interfere with consolidation of the others (particularly weak) memories. Our study proposes a synaptic-level mechanism of how memory consolidation is affected by sensory stimulation during sleep.',\n",

Considerable evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on network changes during anesthesia, but it is unclear whether these changes represent state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (anesthetic vs no anesthetic) effects. We recently demonstrated that carbachol delivery to prefrontal cortex (PFC) restored wakefulness despite continuous administration of the general anesthetic sevoflurane. By contrast, carbachol delivery to parietal cortex, or noradrenaline delivery to either prefrontal or parietal cortices, failed to restore wakefulness. Thus, carbachol-induced reversal of sevoflurane anesthesia represents a unique state that combines wakefulness with clinically relevant anesthetic concentrations in the brain. To differentiate the state-related and drug-related associations of cortical connectivity and dynamics, we analyzed the electroencephalographic data gathered from adult male Sprague Dawley rats during the aforementioned experiments for changes in functional cortical gamma connectivity (25-155 Hz), slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz), and complexity (<175 Hz).

Parkin is a mostly cytosolic protein, but is rapidly recruited to damaged mitochondria and target them for mitophagy. Moreover, Parkin interactomes also involve signaling pathways and transcriptional machinery critical for survival and cell death. However, the mechanism that regulates Parkin protein level remains poorly understood.

       " 'A core goal of visual neuroscience is to predict human perceptual performance from natural signals. Performance in any natural task can be limited by at least three sources of uncertainty: stimulus variability, internal noise, and suboptimal computations. Determining the relative importance of these factors has been a focus of interest for decades but requires methods for predicting the fundamental limits imposed by stimulus variability on sensory-perceptual precision. Most successes have been limited to simple stimuli and simple tasks. But perception science ultimately aims to understand how vision works with natural stimuli. Successes in this domain have proven elusive. Here, we develop a model of humans based on an image-computable (images in, estimates out) Bayesian ideal observer. Given biological constraints, the ideal optimally uses the statistics relating local intensity patterns in moving images to speed, specifying the fundamental limits imposed by natural stimuli. Next, we propose a theoretical link between two key decision-theoretic quantities that suggests how to experimentally disentangle the impacts of internal noise and deterministic suboptimal computations. In several interlocking discrimination experiments with three male observers, we confirm this link and determine the quantitative impact of each candidate performance-limiting factor. Human performance is near-exclusively limited by natural stimulus variability and internal noise, and humans use near-optimal computations to estimate speed from naturalistic image movies. The findings indicate that the partition of behavioral variability can be predicted from a principled analysis of natural images and scenes. The approach should be extendable to studies of neural variability with natural signals.',\n",

At the calyx of Held in rats of either sex, confocal and high-resolution microscopy revealed that MTs enter deep into presynaptic terminal swellings and partially colocalize with a subset of synaptic vesicles (SVs). Electrophysiological analysis demonstrated that depolymerization of MTs specifically prolonged the slow-recovery time component of EPSCs from short-term depression induced by a train of high-frequency stimulation, whereas depolymerization of F-actin specifically prolonged the fast-recovery component. In simultaneous presynaptic and postsynaptic action potential recordings, depolymerization of MTs or F-actin significantly impaired the fidelity of high-frequency neurotransmission.

While IEDs are associated with transient cognitive impairments, it remains poorly understood why this is. We investigated the effects of human (male and female) hippocampal IEDs on single-neuron activity during a memory task in patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergoing depth electrode monitoring. We quantified the effects of hippocampal IEDs on single-neuron activity and the impact of this modulation on subjectively declared memory strength. Across all recorded neurons, the activity of 50 of 728 neurons were significantly modulated by IEDs, with the strongest modulation in the medial temporal lobe (33 of 416) and in particular the right hippocampus (12 of 58). Putative inhibitory neurons, as identified by their extracellular signature, were more likely to be modulated by IEDs than putative excitatory neurons (19 of 157 vs 31 of 571). Behaviorally, the occurrence of hippocampal IEDs was accompanied by a disruption of recognition of familiar images only if they occurred up to 2 s before stimulus onset. In contrast, IEDs did not impair encoding or recognition of novel images, indicating high temporal and task specificity of the effects of IEDs. The degree of modulation of individual neurons by an IED correlated with the declared confidence of a retrieval trial, with higher firing rates indicative of reduced confidence. Together, these data link the transient modulation of individual neurons by IEDs to specific declarative memory deficits in specific cell types, thereby revealing a mechanism by which IEDs disrupt medial temporal lobe-dependent declarative memory retrieval processes.',\n",
       " 'Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts critical physiological systems, including the cardiovascular and immune system. Plasticity of spinal circuits below the injury results in abnormal, heightened sympathetic responses, such as extreme, sudden hypertension that hallmarks life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia. Moreover, such sympathetic hyperreflexia detrimentally impacts other effector organs, including the spleen, resulting in spinal cord injury-induced immunodeficiency. Consequently, infection is a leading cause of mortality after SCI. Unfortunately, there are no current treatments that prophylactically limit sympathetic hyperreflexia to prevent subsequent effector organ dysfunction. The cytokine soluble tumor necrosis factor α (sTNFα) is upregulated in the CNS within minutes after SCI and remains elevated. Here, we report that commencing intrathecal administration of XPro1595, an inhibitor of sTNFα, at a clinically feasible, postinjury time point (i.e., 3 d after complete SCI) sufficiently diminishes maladaptive plasticity within the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit. This results in less severe autonomic dysreflexia, a real-time gauge of sympathetic hyperreflexia, for months postinjury. Remarkably, delayed delivery of the sTNFα inhibitor prevents sympathetic hyperreflexia-associated splenic atrophy and loss of leukocytes to dramatically improve the endogenous ability of chronic SCI rats to fight off pneumonia, a common cause of hospitalization after injury. The improved immune function with XPro1595 correlates with less noradrenergic fiber sprouting and normalized norepinephrine levels in the spleen, indicating that heightened, central sTNFα signaling drives peripheral, norepinephrine-mediated organ dysfunction, a novel mechanism of action. Thus, our preclinical study supports intrathecally targeting sTNFα as a viable strategy to broadly attenuate sympathetic dysregulation, thereby improving cardiovascular regulation and immunity long after SCI.',\n",

Here we explore two other possible manifestations of rhythmic excitability in the beta band; windows of reduced response variability and shortened latency. We delivered single-pulse TMS to the motor cortex of healthy human volunteers (10 females and 7 males) during electroencephalography recordings made at rest. TMS delivered at a particular phase of the beta oscillation benefited from not only stronger, but also less variable and more rapid transmission, as evidenced by the greater amplitude, lower coefficient of variation, and shorter latency of motor evoked potentials. Thus, inputs aligned to the optimal phase of the beta EEG in the motor cortex enjoy transmission amplitude gain, but may also benefit from less variability and shortened latencies at subsequent synapses. Neuronal phase may therefore impact corticospinal communication.',\n",

Here, we present evidence that the nebulin family members LASP1 and LASP2 play an important role in the postsynaptic development of rat hippocampal neurons from both sexes. We find that both LASP1 and LASP2 are enriched in dendritic spines, and their knockdown impairs spine development and synapse formation. Furthermore, LASP2 exerts a distinct role in dendritic arbor and dendritic spine stabilization. Importantly, the actin-binding N-terminal LIM domain and nebulin repeats of LASP2 are required for spine stability and dendritic arbor complexity.

Previous studies have thus far relied on finding neural activity in the corresponding sensory cortices, neglecting potential activity-silent mechanisms, such as connectivity-dependent encoding. It has recently been found that visual stimulation during visual WM maintenance reveals WM-dependent changes through a bottom-up neural response. Here, we test whether this impulse response is uniquely visual and sensory-specific. Human participants (both sexes) completed visual and auditory WM tasks while electroencephalography was recorded. During the maintenance period, the WM network was perturbed serially with fixed and task-neutral auditory and visual stimuli. We show that a neutral auditory impulse-stimulus presented during the maintenance of a pure tone resulted in a WM-dependent neural response, providing evidence for the auditory counterpart to the visual WM findings reported previously. Interestingly, visual stimulation also resulted in an auditory WM-dependent impulse response, implicating the visual cortex in the maintenance of auditory information, either directly or indirectly, as a pathway to the neural auditory WM representations elsewhere. In contrast, during visual WM maintenance, only the impulse response to visual stimulation was content-specific, suggesting that visual information is maintained in a sensory-specific neural network, separated from auditory processing areas.',\n",

It is also unknown if, and in which region(s), activity related to these processes overlaps and/or interacts.

During test, they viewed repeated items (targets), similar items (lures), and new items (foils) and were asked to indicate whether each item was old, similar, or new. Following each item judgment, subjects were asked to indicate the quadrant in which the original stimulus was presented. Thus, each lure trial had a lure discrimination component (taxing pattern separation) and a location judgment (source memory). We found two main response profiles: (1) pattern separation-related signals in DG/CA3 and perirhinal cortex and (2) source memory signals in posterior CA1, parahippocampal cortex, and angular gyrus. Whole-brain voxelwise analysis revealed that activity related to lure discrimination and source memory was largely nonoverlapping.

Altered genetic cargo, usually in the form of miRNAs, have also been identified in EVs patients with these diseases, suggesting that EVs may be a source of disease biomarkers. Whether EVs play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases remains to be firmly established because most current research is performed using cell culture and transgenic animal models. If EVs are identified as a key pathological contributor to neurological conditions, they will form a novel target for therapeutic intervention. This Dual Perspectives article will discuss the current understanding of the role of EVs in neurological diseases and raise some of the limitations of our current understandings of this field.\",\n",
       " 'Intercellular communication has recently been shown to occur via transfer of cargo loaded within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Present within all biofluids of the body, EVs can contain various signaling factors, including coding and noncoding RNAs (e.g., mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, snRNA, tRNA, yRNA), DNA, proteins, and enzymes. Multiple types of cells appear to be capable of releasing EVs, including cancer, stem, epithelial, immune, glial, and neuronal cells. However, the functional impact of these circulating signals among neural networks within the brain has been difficult to establish given the complexity of cellular populations involved in release and uptake, as well as inherent limitations of examining a biofluid. In this brief commentary, we provide an analysis of the conceptual and technical considerations that limit our current understanding of signaling mediated by circulating EVs relative to their impact on neural function.',\n",

This fundamental cellular process is vital in development, plasticity, and response to disease and injury. Compared with neurons, little information is available on autophagy in glia, but it is paramount for glia to perform their critical responses to nervous system disease and injury, including active tissue remodeling and phagocytosis. In myelinating glia, autophagy has expanded roles, particularly in phagocytosis of mature myelin and in generating the vast amounts of membrane proteins and lipids that must be transported to form new myelin. Notably, autophagy plays important roles in removing excess cytoplasm to promote myelin compaction and development of oligodendrocytes, as well as in remyelination by Schwann cells after nerve trauma. This review summarizes the cell biology of autophagy, detailing the major pathways and proteins involved, as well as the roles of autophagy in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes in development, plasticity, and diseases in which myelin is affected. This includes traumatic brain injury, Alexander's disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypoxia, multiple sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and others.

       " 'The activity of neurons is determined by the balance between their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Neurons in the avian nucleus magnocellularis (NM) integrate monosynaptic excitatory and polysynaptic inhibitory inputs from the auditory nerve, and transmit phase-locked output to higher auditory centers. The excitatory input is graded tonotopically, such that neurons tuned to higher frequency receive fewer, but larger, axon terminals. However, it remains unknown how the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is determined in NM. We here examined synaptic and spike responses of NM neurons during stimulation of the auditory nerve in thick brain slices of chicken of both sexes, and found that the excitatory-inhibitory balance varied according to tonotopic region, ensuring reliable spike output across frequencies. Auditory nerve stimulation elicited IPSCs in NM neurons regardless of tonotopic region, but the dependence of IPSCs on intensity varied in a systematic way. In neurons tuned to low frequency, IPSCs appeared and increased in parallel with EPSCs with elevation of intensity, which expanded dynamic range by preventing saturation of spike generation. On the other hand, in neurons tuned to higher frequency, IPSCs were smaller than EPSCs and had higher thresholds for activation, thus facilitating high-fidelity transmission. Computer simulation confirmed that these differences in inhibitory input were optimally matched to the patterns of excitatory input, and enabled appropriate level of neuronal output for wide intensity and frequency ranges of sound in the auditory system.',\n",
       " \"From psychology to economics, there has been substantial interest in how costs (e.g., delay, risk) are represented asymmetrically during decision-making when attempting to gain reward or avoid punishment. For example, in decision-making under risk, individuals show a tendency to prefer to avoid punishment rather than to acquire the equivalent reward (loss aversion). Although the cost of physical effort has recently received significant attention, it remains unclear whether loss aversion exists during effort-based decision-making. On the one hand, loss aversion may be hardwired due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains and therefore exists across decision-making contexts. On the other hand, distinct brain regions are involved with different decision costs, making it questionable whether similar asymmetries exist. Here, we demonstrate that young healthy human participants (females, 16; males, 6) exhibit loss aversion during effort-based decision-making by exerting more physical effort to avoid punishment than to gain a same-size reward. Next, we show that medicated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (females, 9; males, 9) show a reduction in loss aversion compared with age-matched control subjects (females, 11; males, 9). Behavioral and computational analysis revealed that people with PD exerted similar physical effort in return for a reward but were less willing to produce effort to avoid punishment. Therefore, loss aversion is present during effort-based decision-making and can be modulated by altered dopaminergic state. This finding could have important implications for our understanding of clinical disorders that show a reduced willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward.\",\n",

       " 'Computations that require speed and temporal precision are implemented throughout the nervous system by neurons capable of firing at very high rates, rapidly encoding and transmitting a rich amount of information, but with substantial metabolic and physical costs. For economical fast spiking and high throughput information processing, neurons need to optimize multiple biophysical properties in parallel, but the mechanisms of this coordination remain unknown. We hypothesized that coordinated gene expression may underlie the coordinated tuning of the biophysical properties required for rapid firing and signal transmission. Taking advantage of the diversity of fast-spiking cell types in the medial vestibular nucleus of mice of both sexes, we examined the relationship between gene expression, ionic currents, and neuronal firing capacity. Across excitatory and inhibitory cell types, genes encoding voltage-gated ion channels responsible for depolarizing and repolarizing the action potential were tightly coexpressed, and their absolute expression levels increased with maximal firing rate. Remarkably, this coordinated gene expression extended to neurofilaments and specific presynaptic molecules, providing a mechanism for coregulating axon caliber and transmitter release to match firing capacity. These findings suggest the presence of a module of genes, which is coexpressed in a graded manner and jointly tunes multiple biophysical properties for economical differentiation of firing capacity. The graded tuning of fast-spiking capacity by the absolute expression levels of specific ion channels provides a counterexample to the widely held assumption that cell-type-specific firing patterns can be achieved via a vast combination of different ion channels.',\n",
       " 'The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) plays a crucial role in the cognitive processes known as executive functions, which are necessary for the planning of goal-directed behavior in complex and constantly changing environments. To adapt to such environments, the lPFC must use its neuronal resources in a flexible manner. To investigate the mechanism by which lPFC neurons code directional information flexibly, the present study explored the tuning properties and time development of lPFC neurons in male Japanese monkeys during a path-planning task, which required them to move a cursor to a final goal in a stepwise manner within a checkerboard-like maze. We identified \"axis-tuned\" cells that preferred two opposing directions of immediate goals (i.e., vertical and horizontal directions). Among them, a considerable number of these axis-tuned cells dynamically transformed from vector tuning to a single final-goal direction. We also found that the activities of axis-tuned cells, especially pyramidal neurons, were also modulated by the abstract sequence patterns that the animals were to execute. These findings suggest that the axis-tuned cells change what they code (the type of behavioral goal) as well as how they code (their tuning shapes) so that the lPFC can represent a large number of possible actions or sequences with limited neuronal resources. The dynamic axis-tuned cells must reflect the flexible coding of behaviorally relevant information at the single neuron level by the lPFC to adapt to uncertain environments.',\n",
       " 'Cognitive impairments are key features in multiple sclerosis (MS), a progressive disorder characterized by neuroinflammation-induced demyelination in the central nervous system. To understand the neural substrates that link demyelination to cognitive deficits in MS, we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic connectivity of adult-born neurons, which play an essential role in cognitive function. The administration and withdrawal of the combination of cuprizone and rapamycin (Cup/Rap) in C57BL/6J male mice efficiently demyelinated and remyelinated the hippocampus, respectively. In the demyelinated hippocampus, neurogenesis was nearly absent in the dentate gyrus, which was due to inhibited proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Specifically, radial glia-like type 1 NSCs were shifted from a proliferative state to a mitotically-quiescent state in the demyelinated hippocampus. In addition, dendritic spine densities of adult-born neurons were significantly decreased, indicating a reduction in synaptic connections between hippocampal newborn neurons and excitatory input neurons. Concomitant with hippocampal remyelination induced by withdrawal of Cup/Rap, proliferation of type 1 NSCs and dendritic spine densities of adult-born neurons reverted to normal in the hippocampus. Our study shows that proliferation of hippocampal NSCs and synaptic connectivity of adult-born neurons are inversely correlated with the level of demyelination, providing critical insight into hippocampal neurogenesis as a potential therapeutic target to treat cognitive deficits associated with MS.',\n",
       " 'Medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent neurons in the brainstem comprise the final stage of descending control of the mammalian peripheral auditory system through axon projections to the cochlea. MOC activity adjusts cochlear gain and frequency tuning, and protects the ear from acoustic trauma. The neuronal pathways that activate and modulate the MOC somata in the brainstem to drive these cochlear effects are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that MOC neurons are primarily excited by sound stimuli in a three-neuron activation loop from the auditory nerve via an intermediate neuron in the cochlear nucleus. Anatomical studies suggest that MOC neurons receive diverse synaptic inputs, but the functional effect of additional synaptic influences on MOC neuron responses is unknown. Here we use patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from identified MOC neurons in brainstem slices from mice of either sex to demonstrate that in addition to excitatory glutamatergic synapses, MOC neurons receive inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic inputs. These synapses are activated by electrical stimulation of axons near the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Focal glutamate uncaging confirms MNTB neurons as a source of inhibitory synapses onto MOC neurons. MNTB neurons inhibit MOC action potentials, but this effect depresses with repeat activation. This work identifies a new pathway of connectivity between brainstem auditory neurons and indicates that MOC neurons are both excited and inhibited by sound stimuli received at the same ear. The pathway depression suggests that the effect of MNTB inhibition of MOC neurons diminishes over the course of a sustained sound.',\n",
       " 'People suffering from age-related hearing loss typically present with deficits in temporal processing tasks. Temporal processing deficits have also been shown in single-unit studies at the level of the auditory brainstem, midbrain, and cortex of aged animals. In this study, we explored whether temporal coding is already affected at the level of the input to the central auditory system. Single-unit auditory nerve fiber recordings were obtained from 41 Mongolian gerbils of either sex, divided between young, middle-aged, and old gerbils. Temporal coding quality was evaluated as vector strength in response to tones at best frequency, and by constructing shuffled and cross-stimulus autocorrelograms, and reverse correlations, from responses to 1 s noise bursts at 10-30 dB sensation level (dB above threshold). At comparable sensation levels, all measures showed that temporal coding was not altered in auditory nerve fibers of aging gerbils. Furthermore, both temporal fine structure and envelope coding remained unaffected. However, spontaneous rates were decreased in aging gerbils. Importantly, despite elevated pure tone thresholds, the frequency tuning of auditory nerve fibers was not affected. These results suggest that age-related temporal coding deficits arise more centrally, possibly due to a loss of auditory nerve fibers (or their peripheral synapses) but not due to qualitative changes in the responses of remaining auditory nerve fibers. The reduced spontaneous rate and elevated thresholds, but normal frequency tuning, of aged auditory nerve fibers can be explained by the well known reduction of endocochlear potential due to strial dysfunction in aged gerbils.',\n",

       " 'The claustrum connects with a broad range of cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the function of the claustrum (CLA) and its neural projections remains largely unknown. Here, we elucidated the role of the neural projections from the CLA to the PFC in regulating impulsivity in male rats. We first identified the CLA-PFC pathway by retrograde tracer and virus expression. By using immunofluorescent staining of the c-Fos-positive neurons, we showed that chemogenetic activation and inhibition of the CLA-PFC pathway reduced and increased overall activity of the PFC, respectively. In the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), we found that chemogenetic activation and inhibition of the CLA-PFC pathway increased and reduced the impulsive-like behavior (i.e., premature responses), respectively. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of the CLA-PFC pathway prevented methamphetamine-induced impulsivity, without affecting methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity. In contrast to the role of CLA-PFC pathway in selectively regulating impulsivity, activation of the claustrum disrupted attention in the 5-CSRTT. These results indicate that the CLA-PFC pathway is essential for impulsivity. This study may shed light on the understanding of impulsivity-related disorders such as drug addiction.',\n",

In this study, we dissociated tinnitus and hearing loss in FVB mice, which exhibit robust resistance to tinnitus following monaural noise-induced hearing loss. Furthermore, knock-down of glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) expression in auditory cortex (AI) by RNA interference gave rise to tinnitus in normal-hearing FVB mice. We found that tinnitus was significantly correlated with downregulation of GAD65 in the AI. By contrast, cortical map distortions, which have been hypothesized as a mechanism underlying tinnitus, were correlated with hearing loss but not tinnitus.

       " \"Walking and other forms of self-motion create global motion patterns across our eyes. With the resulting stream of visual signals, how do we perceive ourselves as moving through a stable world? Although the neural mechanisms are largely unknown, human studies (Warren and Rushton, 2009) provide strong evidence that the visual system is capable of parsing the global motion into two components: one due to self-motion and the other due to independently moving objects. In the present study, we use computational modeling to investigate potential neural mechanisms for stabilizing visual perception during self-motion that build on neurophysiology of the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas. One such mechanism leverages direction, speed, and disparity tuning of cells in dorsal MST (MSTd) to estimate the combined motion parallax and disparity signals attributed to the observer's self-motion. Feedback from the most active MSTd cell subpopulations suppresses motion signals in MT that locally match the preference of the MSTd cell in both parallax and disparity. This mechanism combined with local surround inhibition in MT allows the model to estimate self-motion while maintaining a sparse motion representation that is compatible with perceptual stability. A key consequence is that after signals compatible with the observer's self-motion are suppressed, the direction of independently moving objects is represented in a world-relative rather than observer-relative reference frame. Our analysis explicates how temporal dynamics and joint motion parallax-disparity tuning resolve the world-relative motion of moving objects and establish perceptual stability. Together, these mechanisms capture findings on the perception of object motion during self-motion.\",\n",

       " \"Humans can rapidly and seemingly implicitly learn to predict typical locations of relevant items when those items are encountered in familiar spatial contexts. Two important questions remain, however, concerning this type of learning: (1) which neural structures and mechanisms are involved in acquiring and exploiting such contextual knowledge? (2) Is this type of learning truly implicit and unconscious? We now answer both these questions after closely examining behavior and recording neural activity using MEG while observers (male and female) were acquiring and exploiting statistical regularities. Computational modeling of behavioral data suggested that, after repeated exposures to a spatial context, participants' behavior was marked by an abrupt switch to an exploitation strategy of the learnt regularities. MEG recordings showed that hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were involved in the task and furthermore revealed a striking dissociation: only the initial learning phase was associated with hippocampal theta band activity, while the subsequent exploitation phase showed a shift in theta band activity to the PFC. Intriguingly, the behavioral benefit of repeated exposures to certain scenes was inversely related to explicit awareness of such repeats, demonstrating the implicit nature of the expectations acquired. Together, these findings demonstrate that (1a) hippocampus and PFC play complementary roles in the implicit, unconscious learning and exploitation of spatial statistical regularities; (1b) these mechanisms are implemented in the theta frequency band; and (2) contextual knowledge can indeed be acquired unconsciously, and awareness of such knowledge can even interfere with the exploitation thereof.\",\n",
       " 'Expectation interacting with nociceptive input can shape the perception of pain. It has been suggested that reward-related expectations are associated with the activation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which projects to the striatum (e.g., nucleus accumbens [NAc]) and prefrontal cortex (e.g., rostral anterior cingulate cortex [rACC]). However, the role of these projection pathways in encoding expectancy effects on pain remains unclear. In this study, we leveraged a visual cue conditioning paradigm with a long pain anticipation period and collected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 30 healthy human subjects (14 females). At the within-subject level, whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analyses showed that the mesocortical pathway (VTA-rACC FC) and the mesolimbic pathway (VTA-NAc FC) were enhanced with positive expectation but inhibited with negative expectation during pain anticipation period. Mediation analyses revealed that cue-based expectancy effects on pain were mainly mediated by the VTA-NAc FC, and structural equation modeling showed that VTA-based FC influenced pain perception by modulating pain-evoked brain responses. At the between-subject level, multivariate pattern analyses demonstrated that gray matter volumes in the VTA, NAc, and rACC were able to predict the magnitudes of conditioned pain responses associated with positive and/or negative expectations across subjects. Our results therefore advance the current understanding of how the reward system is linked to the interaction between expectation and pain. Furthermore, they provide precise functional and structural information on mesocorticolimibic pathways that encode within-subject and between-subject variability of expectancy effects on pain.',\n",
       " 'Local field potentials (LFPs) encode visual information via variations in power at many frequencies. These variations are complex and depend on stimulus and cognitive state in ways that have yet to be fully characterized. Specifically, the frequencies (or combinations of frequencies) that most robustly encode specific types of visual information are not fully known. To address this knowledge gap, we used intracranial EEG to record LFPs at 858 widely distributed recording sites as human subjects (six males, five females) indicated whether briefly presented natural scenes depicted one of three attended object categories. Principal component analysis applied to power spectra of the LFPs near stimulus onset revealed a broadband component (1-100 Hz) and two narrowband components (1-8 and 8-30 Hz, respectively) that encoded information about both seen and attended categories. Interestingly, we found that seen and attended categories were not encoded with the same fidelity by these distinct spectral components. Model-based tuning and decoding analyses revealed that power variations along the broadband component were most sharply tuned and offered more accurate decoding for seen than for attended categories. Power along the narrowband delta-theta (1-8 Hz) component robustly decoded information about both seen and attended categories, while the alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) component was specialized for attention. We conclude that, when viewing natural scenes, information about the seen category is encoded via broadband and sub-gamma (<30 Hz) power variations, while the attended category is most robustly encoded in the sub-gamma range. More generally, these results suggest that power variation along different spectral components can encode qualitatively different kinds of visual information.',\n",

       " 'Origin and functions of intermittent transitions among sleep stages, including brief awakenings and arousals, constitute a challenge to the current homeostatic framework for sleep regulation, focusing on factors modulating sleep over large time scales. Here we propose that the complex micro-architecture characterizing sleep on scales of seconds and minutes results from intrinsic non-equilibrium critical dynamics. We investigate θ- and δ-wave dynamics in control rats and in rats where the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) is lesioned (male Sprague-Dawley rats). We demonstrate that bursts in θ and δ cortical rhythms exhibit complex temporal organization, with long-range correlations and robust duality of power-law (θ-bursts, active phase) and exponential-like (δ-bursts, quiescent phase) duration distributions, features typical of non-equilibrium systems self-organizing at criticality. We show that such non-equilibrium behavior relates to anti-correlated coupling between θ- and δ-bursts, persists across a range of time scales, and is independent of the dominant physiologic state; indications of a basic principle in sleep regulation. Further, we find that VLPO lesions lead to a modulation of cortical dynamics resulting in altered dynamical parameters of θ- and δ-bursts and significant reduction in θ-δ coupling. Our empirical findings and model simulations demonstrate that θ-δ coupling is essential for the emerging non-equilibrium critical dynamics observed across the sleep-wake cycle, and indicate that VLPO neurons may have dual role for both sleep and arousal/brief wake activation. The uncovered critical behavior in sleep- and wake-related cortical rhythms indicates a mechanism essential for the micro-architecture of spontaneous sleep-stage and arousal transitions within a novel, non-homeostatic paradigm of sleep regulation.',\n",

IFNβ enforced activation and polarization of the primary microglial cells to inflammatory M1 phenotype with the secretion of a proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 due to activation of STAT1 signaling.

       " 'Alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz) are assumed to gate information flow in the brain by means of pulsed inhibition; that is, the phasic suppression of cortical excitability and information processing once per alpha cycle, resulting in stronger net suppression for larger alpha amplitudes due to the assumed amplitude asymmetry of the oscillation. While there is evidence for this hypothesis regarding occipital alpha oscillations, it is less clear for the central sensorimotor μ-alpha rhythm. Probing corticospinal excitability via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex and the measurement of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), we have previously demonstrated that corticospinal excitability is modulated by both amplitude and phase of the sensorimotor μ-alpha rhythm. However, the direction of this modulation, its proposed asymmetry, and its underlying mechanisms remained unclear. We therefore used real-time EEG-triggered single- and paired-pulse TMS in healthy humans of both sexes to assess corticospinal excitability and GABA-A-receptor mediated short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) at rest during spontaneous high amplitude μ-alpha waves at different phase angles (peaks, troughs, rising and falling flanks) and compared them to periods of low amplitude (desynchronized) μ-alpha. MEP amplitude was facilitated during troughs and rising flanks, but no phasic suppression was observed at any time, nor any modulation of SICI. These results are best compatible with sensorimotor μ-alpha reflecting asymmetric pulsed facilitation but not pulsed inhibition of motor cortical excitability. The asymmetric excitability with respect to rising and falling flanks of the μ-alpha cycle further reveals that voltage differences alone cannot explain the impact of phase.',\n",

Differential tau isoforms, expression levels, promoters, and disruption of endogenous genes in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the biological role of tau in these models. We addressed this shortcoming by characterizing the molecular and cognitive phenotypes associated with the pathogenic P301L tau mutation (rT2 mice) in relation to a genetically matched transgenic mouse overexpressing nonmutant (NM) 4-repeat (4R) human tau (rT1 mice). Both male and female mice were included in this study. Unexpectedly, we found that 4R NM human tau (hTau) exhibited abnormal dynamics in young mice that were lost with the P301L mutation, including elevated protein stability and hyperphosphorylation, which were associated with cognitive impairment in 5-month-old rT1 mice. Hyperphosphorylation of NM hTau was observed as early as 4 weeks of age, and transgene suppression for the first 4 or 12 weeks of life prevented abnormal molecular and cognitive phenotypes in rT1, demonstrating that NM hTau pathogenicity is specific to postnatal development. We also show that NM hTau exhibits stronger binding to microtubules than P301L hTau, and is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. Overall, our genetically matched mice have revealed that 4R NM hTau overexpression is pathogenic in a manner distinct from classical aging-related tauopathy, underlining the importance of assaying the effects of transgenic disease-related proteins at appropriate stages in life.',\n",

We also find that ∼43% of L1 neurons respond to noise stimuli and at least 14% respond to whisker touch, with these two populations being statistically independent. Finally, we find that 45% of L1 neurons have generally weak responses correlated with whisking activity. Overall, the spatial distributions of modality-specific responses were more or less random.

The dynamic changes of ultrastructural features in postnatal-born neuroblasts during migration are not yet fully understood. Here we report the presence of a primary cilium, and its ultrastructural morphology and spatiotemporal dynamics, in migrating neuroblasts in the postnatal RMS and OB. The primary cilium was observed in migrating neuroblasts in the postnatal RMS and OB in male and female mice and zebrafish, and a male rhesus monkey. Inhibition of intraflagellar transport molecules in migrating neuroblasts impaired their ciliogenesis and rostral migration toward the OB. Serial section transmission electron microscopy revealed that each migrating neuroblast possesses either a pair of centrioles or a basal body with an immature or mature primary cilium. Using immunohistochemistry, live imaging, and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the localization and orientation of the primary cilium are altered depending on the mitotic state, saltatory migration, and deceleration of neuroblasts.

In the 12 years since its initial description, the salience network has been extensively studied, using diverse methods, concepts, and mammalian species, including healthy and diseased humans across the lifespan. Despite this large and growing body of research, the essential functions of the salience network remain uncertain. In this paper, which makes no attempt to comprehensively review this literature, I describe the circumstances surrounding the initial discovery, conceptualization, and naming of the salience network, highlighting aspects that may be unfamiliar to many readers. I then discuss some of the key advances provided by subsequent research and conclude by posing a few of the questions that remain to be explored.',\n",

When the Society was founded 50 years ago to bring neuroscience research under a common banner, sensory research was largely divided along modality-specific lines. At the time, there were only a few physiological and anatomical observations of the multisensory interactions that powerfully influence our everyday perception. Since then, the neuroscientific study of multisensory integration has increased exponentially in both volume and diversity. From initial studies identifying the overlapping receptive fields of multisensory neurons, to subsequent studies of the spatial and temporal principles that govern the integration of multiple sensory cues, our understanding of this phenomenon at the single-neuron level has expanded to include a variety of dimensions. We now can appreciate how multisensory integration can alter patterns of neural activity in time, and even coordinate activity among populations of neurons across different brain areas. There is now a growing battery of sophisticated empirical and computational techniques that are being used to study this process in a number of models. These advancements have not only enhanced our understanding of this remarkable process in the normal adult brain, but also its underlying circuitry, requirements for development, susceptibility to malfunction, and how its principles may be used to mitigate malfunction.',\n",

Learning-modified neural plasticity has been observed in mitral/tufted cells, the main output neurons of the olfactory bulb. Here, we propose that the odor information encoded by mitral/tufted cell responses in awake mice is highly dependent on the behavioral task demands. We used fiber photometry to record calcium signals from the mitral/tufted cell population in awake, head-fixed male mice under different task demands. We found that the mitral/tufted cell population showed similar responses to two distinct odors when the odors were presented in the context of a go/go task, in which the mice received a water reward regardless of the identity of the odor presented. However, when the same odors were presented in a go/no-go task, in which one odor was rewarded and the other was not, then the mitral cell population responded very differently to the two odors, characterized by a robust reduction in the response to the nonrewarded odor. Thus, the representation of odors in the mitral/tufted cell population depends on whether the task requires discrimination of the odors. Strikingly, downstream of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal neurons in the posterior piriform cortex also displayed a task-demand-dependent neural representation of odors, but the anterior piriform cortex did not, indicating that these two important higher olfactory centers use different strategies for neural representation.',\n",

Moment-to-moment fluctuations in waking state or arousal can account for much of this variability. Yet, this variability is rarely characterized across the full spectrum of waking states, leaving the characteristics of the optimal state for sensory processing unresolved. Using pupillometry in concert with extracellular multiunit and intracellular whole-cell recordings, we found that the magnitude and reliability of visually evoked responses in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, passively behaving male mice increase as a function of arousal and are largest during sustained locomotion periods. During these high-arousal, sustained locomotion periods, cortical neuronal membrane potential was at its most depolarized and least variable. Contrastingly, behavioral performance of mice on two distinct visual detection tasks was generally best at a range of intermediate arousal levels, but worst during high arousal with locomotion. These results suggest that large, reliable responses to visual stimuli in V1 occur at a distinct arousal level from that associated with optimal visual detection performance. Our results clarify the relation between neuronal responsiveness and the continuum of waking states, and suggest new complexities in the relation between primary sensory cortical activity and behavior.',\n",

We show that (1) whisking asymmetry is coordinated with behavioral state, and that behavioral state can be decoded and predicted based on asymmetry, (2) even in the absence of tactile input, whisker positioning and asymmetry nevertheless relate to behavioral state, and (3) movement of the nose correlates with asymmetry, indicating that facial expression of the mouse is itself correlated with behavioral state. These results indicate that the movement of whiskers, a behavior that is not instructed or necessary in the task, can inform an observer about what a mouse is doing in the maze. Thus, the position of these mobile tactile sensors reflects a behavioral and movement-preparation state of the mouse.',\n",

In contrast, few single units in V1 show this property. We explored how the strength and dynamics of response vary across the different layers of visual cortex by recording multiunit (defined as high-frequency power in the local field potential) and gamma-band activity evoked by brief presentations of naturalistic and noise images in V1 and V2 of anesthetized macaque monkeys of both sexes. As previously reported, recordings in V2 showed consistently stronger responses to naturalistic texture than to spectrally matched noise. In contrast to single-unit recordings, V1 multiunit activity showed a preference for images with naturalistic statistics, and in gamma-band activity this preference was comparable across V1 and V2. Sensitivity to naturalistic image structure was strongest in the supragranular and infragranular layers of V1, but weak in granular layers, suggesting that it might reflect feedback from V2. Response timing was consistent with this idea. Visual responses appeared first in V1, followed by V2. Sensitivity to naturalistic texture emerged first in V2, followed by the supragranular and infragranular layers of V1, and finally in the granular layers of V1. Our results demonstrate laminar differences in the encoding of higher-order statistics of natural texture, and suggest that this sensitivity first arises in V2 and is fed back to modulate activity in V1.',\n",
       " 'Breathing results from sequential recruitment of muscles in the expiratory, inspiratory, and postinspiratory (post-I) phases of the respiratory cycle. Here we investigate whether neurons in the medullary intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) are components of a central pattern generator (CPG) that generates post-I activity in laryngeal adductors and vasomotor sympathetic nerves and interacts with other members of the central respiratory network to terminate inspiration. We first identified the region of the (male) rat IRt that contains the highest density of lightly cholinergic neurons, many of which are glutamatergic, which aligns well with the putative postinspiratory complex in the mouse (Anderson et al., 2016). Acute bilateral inhibition of this region reduced the amplitudes of post-I vagal and sympathetic nerve activities. However, although associated with reduced expiratory duration and increased respiratory frequency, IRt inhibition did not affect inspiratory duration or abolish the recruitment of post-I activity during acute hypoxemia as predicted. Rather than representing an independent CPG for post-I activity, we hypothesized that IRt neurons may instead function as a relay that distributes post-I activity generated elsewhere, and wondered whether they could be a site of integration for para-respiratory CPGs that drive the same outputs. Consistent with this idea, IRt inhibition blocked rhythmic motor and autonomic components of fictive swallow but not swallow-related apnea. Our data support a role for IRt neurons in the transmission of post-I and swallowing activity to motor and sympathetic outputs, but suggest that other mechanisms also contribute to the generation of post-I activity.',\n",
       " \"Stress responses are coordinated by widespread neural circuits. Homeostatic and psychogenic stressors activate preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) that produce glucagon-like peptide-1; published work in rodents indicates that these neurons play a crucial role in stress responses. While the axonal targets of PPG neurons are well established, their afferent inputs are unknown. Here we use retrograde tracing with cholera toxin subunit b to show that the cNTS in male and female mice receives axonal inputs similar to those reported in rats. Monosynaptic and polysynaptic inputs specific to cNTS PPG neurons were revealed using Cre-conditional pseudorabies and rabies viruses. The most prominent sources of PPG monosynaptic input include the lateral (LH) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus, parasubthalamic nucleus, lateral division of the central amygdala, and Barrington's nucleus (Bar). Additionally, PPG neurons receive monosynaptic vagal sensory input from the nodose ganglia and spinal sensory input from the dorsal horn. Sources of polysynaptic input to cNTS PPG neurons include the hippocampal formation, paraventricular thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. Finally, cNTS-projecting neurons within PVN, LH, and Bar express the activation marker cFOS in mice after restraint stress, identifying them as potential sources of neurogenic stress-induced recruitment of PPG neurons. In summary, cNTS PPG neurons in mice receive widespread monosynaptic and polysynaptic input from brain regions implicated in coordinating behavioral and physiological stress responses, as well as from vagal and spinal sensory neurons. Thus, PPG neurons are optimally positioned to integrate signals of homeostatic and psychogenic stress.\",\n",

Mechanisms of adaptation, a ubiquitous feature of sensory systems, allow for the accommodation of this range of scales. Are there common rules of adaptation across different sensory modalities? We measured the membrane potential responses of individual neurons in the visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortices of male and female mice to discrete, punctate stimuli delivered at a wide range of fixed and nonfixed frequencies. We find that the adaptive profile of the response is largely preserved across these three areas, exhibiting attenuation and responses to the cessation of stimulation, which are signatures of response to changes in stimulus statistics. We demonstrate that these adaptive responses can emerge from a simple model based on the integration of fixed filters operating over multiple time scales.',\n",

Most previous work on GCs has focused on defining properties of distal apical dendrites where these interneurons form reciprocal dendrodendritic connections with principal cells. Less is known about the function of the proximal dendritic compartments. In the present study, we identified the likely action potentials (AP) initiation zone by comparing electrophysiological properties of rat (either sex) GCs with apical dendrites severed at different locations.

In particular the immediate functional consequence of tau misfolding for the individual neuron is not well understood. Here, using microfluidic devices to recreate discretely organized neuronal connections, we show that the spread and propagation of misfolded tau between individual murine neurons is rapid and efficient; it occurs within days. The neurons containing and propagating tau pathology display selective axonal transport deficits but remain viable and electrically competent. Therefore, we demonstrate that seed-competent misfolded tau species do not acutely cause cell death, but instead initiate discrete cellular dysfunctions.\",\n",

Using a within-session behavioral economics (BE) procedure, we previously found that pharmacologic blockade of the OxR1 decreased motivation (increased demand elasticity) for the potent and short-acting opioid remifentanil and reduced low-effort remifentanil consumption. However, the mechanism through which orexin regulates remifentanil demand is currently unknown. Previous work implicated OxR1 signaling within ventral pallidum (VP) as a potential target. VP is densely innervated by orexin fibers and is known to regulate opioid reward. Accordingly, this study sought to determine the role of VP OxR1 signaling in remifentanil demand and cue-induced reinstatement of remifentanil seeking in male rats. Intra-VP microinjections of the OxR1 antagonist SB-334867 (SB) decreased motivation (increased demand elasticity; α) for remifentanil without affecting remifentanil consumption at low effort. Baseline α values predicted the degree of cue-induced remifentanil seeking, and microinjection of SB into VP attenuated this behavior without affecting extinction responding. Baseline α values also predicted SB efficacy, such that SB was most effective in attenuating reinstatement behavior in highly motivated rats. Together, these findings support a selective role for VP OxR1 signaling in motivation for the opioid remifentanil. Our findings also highlight the utility of BE in predicting relapse propensity and efficacy of treatment with OxR1 antagonists.',\n",

We previously showed that, in the majority of Area X neurons FoxP1, FoxP2, and FoxP4 are coexpressed, can dimerize and multimerize with each other and differentially regulate the expression of target genes.

The dentate gyrus (DG) and proximal CA3 (pCA3) regions have been implicated in pattern separation, in part through extracellular recording studies of these areas. However, the DG contains two types of excitatory cells: granule cells of the granule layer and mossy cells of the hilus. Little is known about the firing properties of mossy cells in freely moving animals, and it is unclear how their activity may contribute to the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus. Furthermore, tetrodes in the dentate granule layer and pCA3 pyramidal layer can also record mossy cells, thus introducing ambiguity into the identification of cell types recorded. Using a random forests classifier, we classified cells recorded in DG (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014) and pCA3 (Lee et al., 2015) of 16 male rats and separately examined the responses of granule cells, mossy cells, and pCA3 pyramidal cells in a local/global cue mismatch task. All three cell types displayed low correlations between the population representations of the rat's position in the standard and cue-mismatch sessions. These results suggest that all three excitatory cell types within the DG/pCA3 circuit may act as a single functional unit to support pattern separation.\",\n",

Both normal movements and parkinsonian deficits in this task have striking homology to human performance. In lesioned animals there were several differences in the activity of cortical neurons during reaches by the affected limb compared with control rats. These included an increase in proportions of neurons showing rate decreases, along with increased amplitude of their average rate-decrease response at specific times during the reach, suggesting a shift in the balance of net excitation and inhibition of cortical neurons; a significant increase in the duration of rate-increase responses, which could result from reduced coupling of cortical activity to specific movement components; and changes in the timing and incidence of neurons with pure rate-increase or biphasic responses, particularly at the end of reach when grasping would normally be occurring.

Both prediction confirmations and errors are essential for understanding one's environment, and music offers many of each as it manipulates interacting patterns across multiple timescales. Learning models suggest that a balance of these outcomes (i.e., intermediate complexity) optimizes the reduction of uncertainty to rewarding and pleasurable effect. Yet evidence of a similar pattern in music is mixed, hampered by arbitrary measures of complexity. In the present studies, we applied a well-validated information-theoretic model of auditory expectation to systematically measure two key aspects of musical complexity: predictability (operationalized as information content [IC]), and uncertainty (entropy). In Study 1, we evaluated how these properties affect musical preferences in 43 male and female participants; in Study 2, we replicated Study 1 in an independent sample of 27 people and assessed the contribution of veridical predictability by presenting the same stimuli seven times. Both studies revealed significant quadratic effects of IC and entropy on liking that outperformed linear effects, indicating reliable preferences for music of intermediate complexity. An interaction between IC and entropy further suggested preferences for more predictability during more uncertain contexts, which would facilitate uncertainty reduction. Repeating stimuli decreased liking ratings but did not disrupt the preference for intermediate complexity. Together, these findings support long-hypothesized optimal zones of predictability and uncertainty in musical pleasure with formal modeling, relating the pleasure of music listening to the intrinsic reward of learning.\",\n",

After nerve growth factor withdrawal, sympathetic axons derived from male and female neonatal mice maintain their structural integrity for ∼18 h (latent phase) followed by a rapid and near unison disassembly of axons over the next 3 h (catastrophic phase). Here we examine the molecular basis by which axons transition from latent to catastrophic phases of degeneration following trophic withdrawal. Before catastrophic degeneration, we observed an increase in intra-axonal calcium. This calcium flux is accompanied by p75 neurotrophic factor receptor-Rho-actin-dependent expansion of calcium-rich axonal spheroids that eventually rupture, releasing their contents to the extracellular space. Conditioned media derived from degenerating axons are capable of hastening transition into the catastrophic phase of degeneration. We also found that death receptor 6, but not p75 neurotrophic factor receptor, is required for transition into the catastrophic phase in response to conditioned media but not for the intra-axonal calcium flux, spheroid formation, or rupture that occur toward the end of latency. Our results support the existence of an interaxonal degenerative signal that promotes catastrophic degeneration among trophically deprived axons.',\n",

Despite decades of studies, the underlying calcium sensor remained not well understood. Here, we examined two calcium binding proteins, protein kinase C (PKC) and calmodulin. Whether PKC is involved in endocytosis was unclear; whether calmodulin acts as a calcium sensor for endocytosis was neither clear, although calmodulin involvement in endocytosis had been suggested. We generated PKC (α or β-isoform) and calmodulin (calmodulin 2 gene) knock-out mice of either sex and measured endocytosis with capacitance measurements, pHluorin imaging and electron microscopy. We found that these knock-outs inhibited slow (∼10-30 s) and rapid (<∼3 s) endocytosis at large calyx-type calyces, and inhibited slow endocytosis and bulk endocytosis (forming large endosome-like structures) at small conventional hippocampal synapses, suggesting the involvement of PKC and calmodulin in three most common forms of endocytosis-the slow, rapid and bulk endocytosis. Inhibition of slow endocytosis in PKC or calmodulin 2 knock-out hippocampal synapses was rescued by overexpressing wild-type PKC or calmodulin, but not calcium-binding-deficient PKC or calmodulin mutant, respectively, suggesting that calcium stimulates endocytosis by binding with its calcium sensor PKC and calmodulin. PKC and calmodulin 2 knock-out inhibited calcium-dependent vesicle mobilization to the readily releasable pool, suggesting that PKC and calmodulin may mediate calcium-dependent facilitation of vesicle mobilization.

Male and female human participants first previewed one of several objects and, upon its reappearance, reached to grasp it with the thumb and index finger along one of its two symmetry axes. Object shape classifiers reached transient accuracies of 70% at ∼105 ms, especially based on scalp sites over visual cortex, dropping to lower levels thereafter. Grasp orientation classifiers relied on a system of occipital-to-frontal electrodes. Their accuracy rose concurrently with shape classification but ramped up more gradually, and the slope of the classification curve predicted individual reaction times. Further, cross-temporal generalization revealed that dynamic shape representation involved early and late neural generators that reactivated one another. In contrast, grasp computations involved a chain of generators attaining a sustained state about 100 ms before movement onset. Our results reveal the progression of visual and visuomotor representations over the course of planning and executing grasp movements.',\n",

LMTK1 has been shown to be a p35 Cdk5 activator-binding protein and a substrate for Cdk5-p35; however, its neuronal function has not been sufficiently studied. Here, we investigate the role of LMTK1 in spine formation. Depletion of LMTK1 increases spine formation, maturation, and density in primary cultured neurons and in mouse brain of either sex.

The piriform \"primary\" olfactory cortex, especially its anterior division (aPCX), extends dense association fibers into the ventral striatum\\'s olfactory tubercle (OT), yet whether this corticostriatal pathway is capable of shaping OT activity, including odor-evoked activity, is unknown. Further unresolved is the synaptic circuitry and the spatial localization of OT-innervating PCX neurons. Here we build upon standing literature to provide some answers to these questions through studies in mice of both sexes. First, we recorded the activity of OT neurons in awake mice while optically stimulating principal neurons in the aPCX and/or their association fibers in the OT while the mice were delivered odors. This uncovered evidence that PCX input indeed influences OT unit activity. We then used patch-clamp recordings and viral tracing to determine the connectivity of aPCX neurons upon OT neurons expressing dopamine receptor types D1 or D2, two prominent cell populations in the OT. These investigations uncovered that both populations of neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from aPCX glutamatergic neurons. Interestingly, this input originates largely from the ventrocaudal aPCX. These results shed light on some of the basic physiological properties of this pathway and the cell-types involved and provide a foundation for future studies to identify, among other things, whether this pathway has implications for perception.',\n",

One such advance includes new ultra-large imaging windows on NHP cortex, which are larger than the entire rodent brain and allow analysis unprecedented ultra-large-scale circuits. NHP imaging chambers now remain patent for periods longer than a mouse's lifespan, allowing for long-term all-optical interrogation of identified circuits and neurons over timeframes that are relevant to human cognitive development. Here we present some recent imaging advances brought forth by research teams using macaques and marmosets. These include technical developments in optogenetics; voltage-, calcium- and glutamate-sensitive dye imaging; two-photon and wide-field optical imaging; viral delivery; and genetic expression of indicators and light-activated proteins that result in the visualization of tens of thousands of identified cortical neurons in NHPs.

As a diffuse neuromodulatory system, noradrenaline affects learning and decision making, control of sleep and wakefulness, sensory salience including pain, and the physiology of correlated forebrain activity (ensembles and networks) and brain hemodynamic responses. However, our understanding of the LC is undergoing a dramatic shift due to the application of state-of-the-art methods that reveal a nucleus of many modules that provide targeted neuromodulation. Here, we review the evidence supporting a modular LC based on multiple levels of observation (developmental, genetic, molecular, anatomical, and neurophysiological).

       " 'Beta oscillations (∼13 to 30 Hz) have been observed during many perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes in a plethora of brain recording studies. Although the function of beta oscillations (hereafter \"beta\" for short) is unlikely to be explained by any single monolithic description, we here discuss several convergent findings. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), increased beta appears at the end of a trial when working memory information needs to be erased. A similar \"clear-out\" function might apply during the stopping of action and the stopping of long-term memory retrieval (stopping thoughts), where increased prefrontal beta is also observed. A different apparent role for beta in PFC occurs during the delay period of working memory tasks: it might serve to maintain the current contents and/or to prevent interference from distraction. We confront the challenge of relating these observations to the large literature on beta recorded from sensorimotor cortex. Potentially, the clear-out of working memory in PFC has its counterpart in the postmovement clear-out of the motor plan in sensorimotor cortex. However, recent studies support alternative interpretations. In addition, we flag emerging research on different frequencies of beta and the relationship between beta and single-neuron spiking. We also discuss where beta might be generated: basal ganglia, cortex, or both. We end by considering the clinical implications for adaptive deep-brain stimulation.',\n",

How sensory information is handled in PBN and used to inform different outputs to maintain homeostasis and promote survival is only now being elucidated. With a focus on taste and ingestive behaviors, pain, and thermoregulation, this review is intended to provide a context for analysis of PBN circuits involved in aversion and avoidance, and consider how information of various modalities, interoceptive and exteroceptive, is processed within PBN and transmitted to distinct targets to signal challenge, and to engage appropriate behavioral and physiological responses to maintain homeostasis.',\n",

Until recently, a consensus formed that after exocytosis, SVs are recovered by either fusion pore closure (kiss-and-run) or clathrin-mediated endocytosis directly from the plasma membrane. However, recent data have revealed that SV formation is more complex than previously envisaged. For example, two additional recycling pathways have been discovered, ultrafast endocytosis and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis, in which SVs are regenerated from the internalized membrane and synaptic endosomes. Furthermore, these diverse modes of endocytosis appear to influence both the molecular composition and subsequent physiological role of individual SVs. In addition, previously unknown complexity in SV refilling and reclustering has been revealed. This review presents a modern view of the SV life cycle and discusses how neuronal subtype, physiological temperature, and individual activity patterns can recruit different endocytic modes to generate new SVs and sculpt subsequent presynaptic performance.',\n",

Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered mitochondrial dynamics are observed in a wide range of conditions, from impaired neuronal development to various neurodegenerative diseases. Novel imaging techniques and genetic tools provide unprecedented access to the physiological roles of mitochondria by visualizing mitochondrial trafficking, morphological dynamics, ATP generation, and ultrastructure.

Previous studies have shown SAAs are elevated following stroke and cerebral ischemia, and our studies demonstrated that SAA-deficient mice reduce inflammation and infarct volumes in a mouse stroke model. Our studies demonstrate that SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin B, and caspase-1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. SAA induced the expression of NLRP3, which mediated IL-1β induction in murine BV-2 cells and both sex primary mouse microglial cells, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Inhibition or KO of the NLRP3 in microglia prevented the increase in IL-1β. ',\n",

Neuronal circuits in early visual areas make these predictions based on internal models that are delivered via non-feedforward connections. Despite our extensive knowledge of the feedforward sensory features that drive cortical neurons, we have a limited grasp on the structure of the brain's internal models. Progress in neuroscience therefore depends on our ability to replicate the models that the brain creates internally. Here we record human fMRI data while presenting partially occluded visual scenes. Visual occlusion allows us to experimentally control sensory input to subregions of visual cortex while internal models continue to influence activity in these regions. Because the observed activity is dependent on internal models, but not on sensory input, we have the opportunity to map visual features conveyed by the brain's internal models. Our results show that activity related to internal models in early visual cortex are more related to scene-specific features than to categorical or depth features. We further demonstrate that behavioral line drawings provide a good description of internal model structure representing scene-specific features. These findings extend our understanding of internal models, showing that line drawings provide a window into our brains' internal models of vision.\",\n",

Different terminals of the sensorimotor network show varied somatotopic layouts, in which the relative position, distance, and overlap between body-part representations differ. Since somatotopy is best characterized in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, these terminals have been the main focus of research on somatotopic remapping following loss of sensory input (e.g., arm amputation). Cortical remapping is generally considered to be driven by the layout of the underlying somatotopy, such that neighboring body-part representations tend to activate the deprived brain region.

Aversive taste learning and retrieval require neuronal activity within the anterior insula (aIC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Here, we labeled neurons of the aIC projecting to the BLA in adult male mice using a retro-AAV construct and assessed their necessity in aversive and appetitive taste learning. By restricting the expression of chemogenetic receptors in aIC-to-BLA neurons, we demonstrate that activity within the aIC-to-BLA projection is necessary for both aversive taste memory acquisition and retrieval, but not for its maintenance, nor its extinction. Moreover, inhibition of the projection did not affect incidental taste learning per se, but effectively suppressed aversive taste memory retrieval when applied either during or before the encoding of the unconditioned stimulus for CTA (i.e., malaise). Remarkably, activation of the projection after novel taste consumption, without experiencing any internal discomfort, was sufficient to form an artificial aversive taste memory, resulting in strong aversive behavior upon retrieval. Our results indicate that aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons are an essential component in the ability of the brain to associate taste sensory stimuli with body states of negative valence and guide the expression of valence-specific behavior upon taste memory retrieval.',\n",

We also provide evidence that TERT and p53 act downstream of c-Myc to control sensory axon regeneration. More importantly, overexpression of p53 in sensory neurons and retinal ganglion cells is sufficient to promote sensory axon and optic never regeneration, respectively. The study reveals a novel c-Myc-TERT-p53 signaling pathway, expanding horizons for novel approaches promoting CNS axon regeneration.',\n",

A notable consequence of seizures is the induction of aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. However, regulatory mechanisms governing these features during epilepsy development are not fully understood. Recent studies show that microglia, the brain's resident immune cell, contribute to normal neurogenesis and regulate seizure phenotypes. However, the role of microglia in aberrant neurogenic seizure contexts has not been adequately investigated. To address this question, we coupled the intracerebroventricular kainic acid model with current pharmacogenetic approaches to eliminate microglia in male mice. We show that microglia promote seizure-induced neurogenesis and subsequent seizure-induced immature neuronal projections above and below the pyramidal neurons between the DG and the CA3 regions. Furthermore, we identify microglial P2Y12 receptors (P2Y12R) as a participant in this neurogenic process. Together, our results implicate microglial P2Y12R signaling in epileptogenesis and provide further evidence for targeting microglia in general and microglial P2Y12R in specific to ameliorate proepileptogenic processes.\",\n",

Recent work has identified substantial divergence of molecular composition between commonly studied Schaffer collateral synapses and perforant path-dentate gyrus (DG) synapses of the hippocampus. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that may confer unique properties to perforant path-DG synapses. Here we investigate whether the RhoGEF (Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor) protein Tiam1 plays a unique role in the regulation of glutamatergic synapses in dentate granule neurons using a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and imaging approaches in rat entorhino-hippocampal slices of both sexes. We find that inhibition of Tiam1 function in dentate granule neurons reduces synaptic AMPA receptor function and causes dendritic spines to adopt an elongated filopodia-like morphology. We also find that Tiam1's support of perforant path-DG synapse function is dependent on its GEF domain and identify a potential role for the auto-inhibitory PH domain of Tiam1 in regulating Tiam1 function at these synapses. In marked contrast, reduced Tiam1 expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons produced no effect on glutamatergic synapse development. Together, these data identify a critical role for Tiam1 in the hippocampus and reveal a unique Tiam1-mediated molecular program of glutamatergic synapse regulation in dentate granule neurons.\",\n",

White matter stroke stimulates adjacent oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to divide and migrate to the lesion, but stroke OPCs have only a limited differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. To understand the molecular systems that are active in OPC responses in white matter stroke, OPCs were virally labeled and laser-captured in the region of partial damage adjacent to the infarct in male mice. RNAseq indicates two distinct OPC transcriptomes associated with the proliferative and limited-regeneration phases of OPCs after stroke. Molecular pathways related to nuclear receptor activation, ECM turnover, and lipid biosynthesis are activated during proliferative OPC phases after stroke; inflammatory and growth factor signaling is activated in the later stage of limited OPC differentiation. Within ECM proteins, Matrilin-2 is induced early after stroke and then rapidly downregulated. Prediction of upstream regulators of the OPC stroke transcriptome identifies several candidate molecules, including Inhibin A-a negative regulator of Matrilin-2. Inhibin A is induced in reactive astrocytes after stroke, including in humans. In functional assays, Matrilin-2 induces OPC differentiation, and Inhibin A inhibits OPC Matrilin-2 expression and inhibits OPC differentiation. ',\n",

Age-specific responses to social affect are evident when an adult male rat is presented with a pair of unfamiliar male conspecifics, one of which is stressed via two foot shocks and the other naive to treatment. Adult test rats prefer to interact with stressed juvenile (postnatal day 30, PN30) conspecifics but avoid stressed adult (PN50) conspecifics. This pattern depends upon the insular cortex (IC), which is anatomically connected to the nucleus accumbens core (NAc). The goal of this work was to test the necessity of IC projections to NAc during social affective behavior. Here, bilateral pharmacological inhibition of the NAc with tetrodotoxin (1 μm; 0.5 μl/side) abolished the preference for stressed PN30, but did not alter interactions with PN50 conspecifics. Using a combination of retrograding tracing and c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we report that social interactions with stressed PN30 conspecifics elicit greater Fos immunoreactivity in IC → NAc neurons than interactions with naive PN30 conspecifics. Chemogenetic stimulation of IC terminals in the NAc increased social exploration with juvenile, but not adult, conspecifics, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of this tract blocked the preference to investigate stressed PN30 conspecifics, which expands upon our previous finding that optogenetic inhibition of IC projection neurons mediated approach and avoidance. These new findings suggest that outputs of IC to the NAc modulate social approach, which provides new insight to the neural circuitry underlying social decision-making.',\n",

Here we used genetically modified rats and mice of both sexes to show that p75NTR regulates the duration of the GCP cell cycle, requiring activation of RhoA. Rats and mice lacking p75NTR have dysregulated GCP proliferation, with deleterious effects on cerebellar circuit development and behavioral consequences persisting into adulthood. In the absence of p75NTR, the GCP cell cycle is accelerated, leading to delayed cell cycle exit, prolonged GCP proliferation, increased glutamatergic input to Purkinje cells, and a deficit in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent form of learning.

When facing a sensory prediction error, should we attribute this error to a change in our body, and update the body internal model, or to a change in the environment? In the latter case, should we update an existing perturbation model or create a new model? Here, we propose that a decision-making process compares the models' prediction errors, weighted by their precisions, to select and update either the body model or an existing perturbation model. When no model can predict a perturbation, a new perturbation model is created and selected. When a model is selected, both the prediction's mean estimate and uncertainty are updated to minimize future prediction errors and to increase the precision of the predictions. Results from computer simulations, which we verified in an arm visuomotor adaptation experiment with subjects of both sexes, account for short aftereffects and large savings after adaptation to large, but not small, perturbations. Results also clarify previous data in the absence of errors (error-clamp): motor memories show an initial lack of decay after a large perturbation, but gradual decay after a small perturbation. Finally, qualitative individual differences in adaptation were explained by subjects selecting and updating either the body model or a perturbation model. Our results suggest that motor adaptation belongs to a general class of learning according to which memories are created when no existing memories can predict sensory data accurately and precisely.\",\n",

We here investigated the subcortical involvement in reward related top-down control of visual alpha-band oscillations (8-13 Hz), which have been consistently linked to mechanisms supporting the allocation of visuospatial attention. Given that items associated with contextual saliency (e.g., monetary reward or loss) attract attention, it is not surprising that the acquired salience of visual items further modulates. The executive networks controlling such reward-dependent modulations of oscillatory brain activity have yet to be fully elucidated. Although such networks have been explored in terms of corticocortical interactions, subcortical regions are likely to be involved. To uncover this, we combined MRI and MEG data from 17 male and 11 female participants, investigating whether derived measures of subcortical structural asymmetries predict interhemispheric modulation of alpha power during a spatial attention task. We show that volumetric hemispheric lateralization of globus pallidus (GP) and thalamus (Th) explains individual hemispheric biases in the ability to modulate posterior alpha power. Importantly, for the GP, this effect became stronger when the value saliency parings in the task increased. Our findings suggest that the GP and Th in humans are part of a subcortical executive control network, differentially involved in modulating posterior alpha activity in the presence of saliency. Further investigation aimed at uncovering the interaction between subcortical and neocortical attentional networks would provide useful insight in future studies.',\n",

Adaptation is hypothesized to be a critical property of MET that contributes to the auditory system's wide dynamic range and sharp frequency selectivity. Our recent work using a stiff probe to displace hair bundles showed that the fastest adaptation mechanism (fast adaptation) does not require calcium entry. Using fluid-jet stimuli, others obtained data showing only a calcium-dependent fast adaptation response. Because cochlear stereocilia do not move coherently and the hair cell response depends critically on the magnitude and time course of the hair bundle deflection, we developed a high-speed imaging technique to quantify this deflection in rat cochlear hair cells. The fluid jet delivers a force stimulus, and force steps lead to a complex time course of hair bundle displacement (mechanical creep), which affects the hair cell's macroscopic MET current response by masking the time course of the fast adaptation response. Modifying the fluid-jet stimulus to generate a hair bundle displacement step produced rapidly adapting currents that did not depend on membrane potential, confirming that fast adaptation does not depend on calcium entry.

One solution to this problem would be to co-opt the \"temporal\" guidance mechanisms that control the rate of axon growth during development to accelerate the rate at which nerves regenerate in adults. We have previously found that the loss of Limk1, a negative regulator of cofilin, accelerates the rate of spinal commissural axon growth. Here, we use mouse models to show that spinal motor axon outgrowth is similarly promoted by the loss of Limk1, suggesting that temporal guidance mechanisms are widely used during development. Furthermore, we find that the regulation of cofilin activity is an acute response to nerve injury in the peripheral nervous system. Within hours of a sciatic nerve injury, the level of phosphorylated cofilin dramatically increases at the lesion site, in a Limk1-dependent manner. This response may be a major constraint on the rate of peripheral nerve regeneration.

       " \"LTP, a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory, is a highly regulated process. One form of regulation is metaplasticity (i.e., the activity-dependent and long-lasting changes in neuronal state that orchestrate the direction, magnitude, and persistence of future synaptic plasticity). We have previously described a heterodendritic metaplasticity effect, whereby strong high-frequency priming stimulation in stratum oriens inhibits subsequent LTP in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1, potentially by engagement of the enmeshed astrocytic network. This effect may occur due to neuron-glia interactions in response to priming stimulation that leads to the release of gliotransmitters. Here we found in male rats that TNFα and associated signal transduction enzymes, but not interleukin-1β (IL-1β), were responsible for mediating the metaplasticity effect. Replacing priming stimulation with TNFα incubation reproduced these effects. As TNFα levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease, we examined whether heterodendritic metaplasticity is dysregulated in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, either before or after amyloid plaque formation. We showed that TNFα and IL-1β levels were significantly increased in aged but not young transgenic mice. Although control LTP was impaired in the young transgenic mice, it was not TNFα-dependent. In the older transgenic mice, however, LTP was impaired in a way that occluded further reduction by heterosynaptic metaplasticity, whereas LTP was entirely rescued by incubation with a TNFα antibody, but not an IL-1β antibody. Thus, TNFα mediates a heterodendritic metaplasticity in healthy rodents that becomes constitutively and selectively engaged in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",
       " 'The brain is thought to combine linguistic knowledge of words and nonlinguistic knowledge of their referents to encode sentence meaning. However, functional neuroimaging studies aiming at decoding language meaning from neural activity have mostly relied on distributional models of word semantics, which are based on patterns of word co-occurrence in text corpora. Here, we present initial evidence that modeling nonlinguistic \"experiential\" knowledge contributes to decoding neural representations of sentence meaning. We model attributes of peoples\\' sensory, motor, social, emotional, and cognitive experiences with words using behavioral ratings. We demonstrate that fMRI activation elicited in sentence reading is more accurately decoded when this experiential attribute model is integrated with a text-based model than when either model is applied in isolation (participants were 5 males and 9 females). Our decoding approach exploits a representation-similarity-based framework, which benefits from being parameter free, while performing at accuracy levels comparable with those from parameter fitting approaches, such as ridge regression. We find that the text-based model contributes particularly to the decoding of sentences containing linguistically oriented \"abstract\" words and reveal tentative evidence that the experiential model improves decoding of more concrete sentences. Finally, we introduce a cross-participant decoding method to estimate an upper bound on model-based decoding accuracy. We demonstrate that a substantial fraction of neural signal remains unexplained, and leverage this gap to pinpoint characteristics of weakly decoded sentences and hence identify model weaknesses to guide future model development.',\n",
       " \"A major cue to infer sound direction is the difference in arrival time of the sound at the left and right ears, called interaural time difference (ITD). The neural coding of ITD and its similarity across species have been strongly debated. In the barn owl, an auditory specialist relying on sound localization to capture prey, ITDs within the physiological range determined by the head width are topographically represented at each frequency. The topographic representation suggests that sound direction may be inferred from the location of maximal neural activity within the map. Such topographical representation of ITD, however, is not evident in mammals. Instead, the preferred ITD of neurons in the mammalian brainstem often lies outside the physiological range and depends on the neuron's best frequency. Because of these disparities, it has been assumed that how spatial hearing is achieved in birds and mammals is fundamentally different. However, recent studies reveal ITD responses in the owl's forebrain and midbrain premotor area that are consistent with coding schemes proposed in mammals. Particularly, sound location in owls could be decoded from the relative firing rates of two broadly and inversely ITD-tuned channels. This evidence suggests that, at downstream stages, the code for ITD may not be qualitatively different across species. Thus, while experimental evidence continues to support the notion of differences in ITD representation across species and brain regions, the latest results indicate notable commonalities, suggesting that codes driving orienting behavior in mammals and birds may be comparable.\",\n",

This modulation includes both increase and decrease in response amplitude and is similar between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The overall change in the SC is small, whereas V1 responses almost double during locomotion. Additionally, SC neurons display lower response variability and less spontaneous activity than V1 neurons.

This notion has driven treatments that aim to restore S1 representations in CRPS patients, such as sensory discrimination training and mirror therapy. However, this notion is based on both indirect and incomplete evidence obtained with imaging methods with low spatial resolution. Here, we used fMRI to characterize the S1 representation of the affected and unaffected hand in humans (of either sex) with unilateral CRPS. The cortical area, location, and geometry of the S1 representation of the CRPS hand were largely comparable with those of both the unaffected hand and healthy controls.

The probability of evoking ASR by suprathreshold sound is reduced after exposure to repetitive auditory stimuli insufficient in amplitude to evoke the ASR (subthreshold).

The central mechanism for noise mitigation in the nervous system is thought to involve averaging over multiple noise-corrupted inputs. Subsequently, there has been considerable interest in identifying noise structures that can be integrated linearly in a way that preserves reliable signal encoding. By analyzing realistic synaptic integration in biophysically accurate neuronal models, I report a complementary denoising approach that is mediated by focal dendritic spikes. Dendritic spikes might seem to be unlikely candidates for noise reduction due to their miniscule integration compartments and poor averaging abilities. Nonetheless, the extra thresholding step introduced by dendritic spike generation increases neuronal tolerance for a broad category of noise structures, some of which cannot be resolved well with averaging. This property of active dendrites compensates for compartment size constraints and expands the repertoire of conditions that can be processed by neuronal populations.',\n",
       " 'The primary visual cortex contains a detailed map of retinal stimulus position (retinotopic map) and eye input (ocular dominance map) that results from the precise arrangement of thalamic afferents during cortical development. For reasons that remain unclear, the patterns of ocular dominance are very diverse across species and can take the shape of highly organized stripes, convoluted beads, or no pattern at all. Here, we use a new image-processing algorithm to measure ocular dominance patterns more accurately than in the past. We use these measurements to demonstrate that ocular dominance maps follow a common organizing principle that makes the cortical axis with the slowest retinotopic gradient orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes. We demonstrate this relation in multiple regions of the primary visual cortex from individual animals, and different species. Moreover, consistent with the increase in the retinotopic gradient with visual eccentricity, we demonstrate a strong correlation between eccentricity and ocular dominance stripe width. We also show that an eye/polarity grid emerges within the visual cortical map when the representation of light and dark stimuli segregates along an axis orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes, as recently demonstrated in cats. Based on these results, we propose a developmental model of visual cortical topography that sorts thalamic afferents by eye input and stimulus polarity, and then maximizes the binocular retinotopic match needed for depth perception and the light-dark retinotopic mismatch needed to process stimulus orientation. In this model, the different ocular dominance patterns simply emerge from differences in local retinotopic cortical topography.',\n",

In many animals, GABA-ergic neurons inhibit spike activities of higher-order olfactory neurons and help sparsening of their odor representations. In the cockroach, two different types of GABA-immunoreactive interneurons (calyceal giants [CGs]) mainly project to the base and lip regions of the calyces (input areas) of the mushroom body (MB), a second-order olfactory center. The base and lip regions receive axon terminals of two different types of projection neurons, which receive synapses from different classes of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and receive dendrites of different classes of Kenyon cells, MB intrinsic neurons. We performed intracellular recordings from pairs of CGs and MB output neurons (MBONs) of male American cockroaches, the latter receiving synapses from Kenyon cells, and we found that a CG receives excitatory synapses from an MBON and that odor responses of the MBON are changed by current injection into the CG. Such feedback effects, however, were often weak or absent in pairs of neurons that belong to different streams, suggesting parallel organization of the recurrent pathways, although interactions between different streams were also evident. Cross-covariance analysis of the spike activities of CGs and MBONs suggested that odor stimulation produces synchronized spike activities in MBONs and then in CGs. We suggest that there are separate but interactive parallel streams to process odors detected by different OSNs throughout the olfactory processing system in cockroaches.',\n",

We used spatial discrimination techniques to explore the late maturation of synaptic pathways through the laminar distribution of the field potential (FP) generators underlying spontaneous and evoked activities of the S1HL cortex in juvenile (P14-P16) and adult anesthetized rats. Juveniles exhibit an intermittent FP pattern resembling Up/Down states in adults, but with much reduced power and different laminar distribution. Whereas FPs in active periods are dominated by a layer VI generator in juveniles, in adults a developing multipart generator takes over, displaying current sinks in middle layers (III-V). The blockade of excitatory transmission in upper and middle layers of adults recovered the juvenile-like FP profiles. In addition to the layer VI generator, a gamma-specific generator in supragranular layers was the same in both age groups. While searching for dynamical coupling among generators in juveniles we found significant cross-correlation in ∼one-half of the tested pairs, whereas excessive coherence hindered their efficient separation in adults. Also, potentials evoked by tactile and electrical stimuli showed different short-latency dipoles between the two age groups, and the juveniles lacked the characteristic long latency UP state currents in middle layers. In addition, the mean firing rate of neurons was lower in juveniles. Thus, cortical FPs originate from different intra-columnar segments as they become active postnatally. We suggest that although some cortical segments are active early postnatally, a functional sensory-motor control relies on a delayed maturation and network integration of synaptic connections in middle layers.',\n",

However, the basic neuronal composition of the parasubiculum remains largely unknown, and its border with the MEC is often ambiguous. We combine electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry in adult mice (both sexes) to define first, the boundaries of the parasubiculum, and second, the major cell types found in this region. We find distinct differences in the colabeling of molecular markers between the parasubiculum and the MEC, allowing us to clearly separate the two structures. Moreover, we find distinct distribution patterns of different molecular markers within the parasubiculum, across both superficial-deep and DV axes. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, we find that neurons in the parasubiculum can be broadly separated into three clusters based on their electrophysiological properties, and that each cluster corresponds to a different molecular marker. We demonstrate that, while the parasubiculum aligns structurally to some to general cortical principals, it also shows divergent features in particular in contrast to the MEC.

Here we used an object-scene mnemonic discrimination task in combination with fMRI recordings and analyzed the relationship between subregional MTL activity, memory performance, and levels of total and phosphorylated tau as well as Aβ42/40 ratio in CSF. We show that activity in alEC was associated with mnemonic discrimination of similar objects but not scenes in male and female cognitively unimpaired older adults. Importantly, CSF tau levels were associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, and both increased hippocampal activity as well as tau levels were associated with mnemonic discrimination of objects, but again not scenes.

In humans, consolidation during sleep is correlated with scalp-recorded spindles and downstates/upstates, but HC-SWRs cannot be recorded noninvasively. Here we show in humans of both sexes that HC-SWRs are highly correlated with NC-GEs during NREM, with significantly more related HC-SWRs/NC-GEs for downstates or upstates than theta bursts or spindles, in N2 than N3, in posterior than anterior HC, in frontal than occipital cortex, and ipsilaterally than contralaterally. The preferences interacted (e.g., frontal spindles co-occurred frequently with posterior HC-SWRs in N2). These preferred GEs, stages, and locations for HC-SWR/NC-GE interactions may index selective consolidation activity, although that was not tested in this study. SWR recorded in different HC regions seldom co-occurred, and were related to GE in different cortical areas, showing that HC-NC interact in multiple transient, widespread but discrete, networks. NC-GEs tend to occur with consistent temporal relationships to HC-SWRs, and to each other. Cortical theta bursts usually precede HC-SWRs, where they may help define cortical input triggering HC-SWR firing. HC-SWRs often follow cortical downstate onsets, surrounded by locally decreased broadband power, suggesting a mechanism synchronizing cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal activities. Widespread cortical upstates and spindles follow HC-SWRs, consistent with the hypothesized contribution by hippocampal firing during HC-SWRs to cortical firing-patterns during upstates and spindles.

Low-frequency neural oscillations are also relevant to stimulus processing and information flow, however, their distribution within auditory cortex has not been established. Alpha activity (7-14 Hz) in particular has been associated with processes that may differentially engage earlier versus later levels of the cortical hierarchy, including functional inhibition and the communication of sensory predictions. These theories derive largely from the study of occipitoparietal sources readily detectable in scalp electroencephalography. To characterize the anatomical basis and functional significance of less accessible temporal-lobe alpha activity we analyzed responses to sentences in seven human adults (4 female) with epilepsy who had been implanted with electrodes in superior temporal cortex. In contrast to primary cortex in posteromedial HG, a non-primary field in anterolateral HG was characterized by high spontaneous alpha activity that was strongly suppressed during auditory stimulation. Alpha-power suppression decreased with distance from anterolateral HG throughout superior temporal cortex, and was more pronounced for clear compared to degraded speech. This suppression could not be accounted for solely by a change in the slope of the power spectrum. The differential manifestation and stimulus-sensitivity of alpha oscillations across auditory fields should be accounted for in theories of their generation and function.\",\n",

We show that while pHC generates SWRs, it also generates approximately as many spindle ripples (SSR: ripples phase-locked to local spindles). In contrast, SSRs are rare in aHC. Like SWRs, SSRs often co-occur with neocortical theta bursts (TBs), downstates (DSs), sleep spindles (SSs), and upstates (USs), which coordinate cortico-hippocampal interactions and facilitate consolidation in rodents. SWRs co-occur with these waves in widespread cortical areas, especially frontocentral. These waves typically occur in the sequence TB-DS-SS-US, with SWRs usually occurring before SS-US. In contrast, SSRs occur ∼350 ms later, with a strong preference for co-occurrence with posterior-parietal SSs. pHC-SSs were strongly phase-locked with parietal-SSs, and pHC-SSRs were phase-coupled with pHC-SSs and parietal-SSs.

       " 'Natural sounds such as vocalizations often have covarying acoustic attributes, resulting in redundancy in neural coding. The efficient coding hypothesis proposes that sensory systems are able to detect such covariation and adapt to reduce redundancy, leading to more efficient neural coding. Recent psychoacoustic studies have shown the auditory system can rapidly adapt to efficiently encode two covarying dimensions as a single dimension, following passive exposure to sounds in which temporal and spectral attributes covaried in a correlated fashion. However, these studies observed a cost to this adaptation, which was a loss of sensitivity to the orthogonal dimension. Here we explore the neural basis of this psychophysical phenomenon by recording single-unit responses from the primary auditory cortex in awake ferrets exposed passively to stimuli with two correlated attributes, similar in stimulus design to the psychoacoustic experiments in humans. We found: (1) the signal-to-noise ratio of spike-rate coding of cortical responses driven by sounds with correlated attributes remained unchanged along the exposure dimension, but was reduced along the orthogonal dimension; (2) performance of a decoder trained with spike data to discriminate stimuli along the orthogonal dimension was equally reduced; (3) correlations between neurons tuned to the two covarying attributes decreased after exposure; and (4) these exposure effects still occurred if sounds were correlated along two acoustic dimensions, but varied randomly along a third dimension. These neurophysiological results are consistent with the efficient coding hypothesis and may help deepen our understanding of how the auditory system encodes and represents acoustic regularities and covariance.',\n",
       " 'Cognitive flexibility is critical for intelligent behavior. However, its execution is effortful and often suboptimal. Recent work indicates that flexible behavior can be improved by the prospect of reward, which suggests that rewards optimize flexible control processes. Here we investigated how different reward prospects influence neural encoding of task rule information to optimize cognitive flexibility. We applied representational similarity analysis to human electroencephalograms, recorded while female and male participants performed a rule-guided decision-making task. During the task, the prospect of reward varied from trial to trial. Participants made faster, more accurate judgements on high-reward trials. Critically, high reward boosted neural coding of the active task rule, and the extent of this increase was associated with improvements in task performance. Additionally, the effect of high reward on task rule coding was most pronounced on switch trials, where rules were updated relative to the previous trial. These results suggest that reward prospect can promote cognitive performance by strengthening neural coding of task rule information, helping to improve cognitive flexibility during complex behavior.',\n",

Knockdown of spinal piR-DQ541777 alleviated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia and spinal neuronal sensitization. However, the overexpression of spinal piR-DQ541777 in naive mice produced pain behaviors and increased spinal neuron sensitization.

       " 'Segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events is driven by rapid fluctuations in encoding stability at context shifts (i.e., event boundaries), yet the mechanisms underlying the online formation of event memories are poorly understood. We investigated the neural per-time point spatial similarity patterns of the scalp electrophysiological (EEG) activity of 30 human participants (male and female) watching a 50 min movie and found that event boundaries triggered the rapid reinstatement of the just-encoded movie event EEG patterns. We also found that the onset of memory reinstatement at boundary onset was accompanied by a left-lateralized anterior negative ERP effect, which likely reflects the detection of a shift in the narrative structure of the movie. A data-driven approach based on Hidden Markov modeling allowed us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain EEG activity during encoding, and to identify their reactivation during a free recall task. These results provide the first neurophysiological underpinnings for how the memory systems segment a continuous long stream of experience into episodic events.',\n",
       " 'Human vision combines inputs from the two eyes into one percept. Small differences \"fuse\" together, whereas larger differences are seen \"rivalrously\" from one eye at a time. These outcomes are typically treated as mutually exclusive processes, with paradigms targeting one or the other and fusion being unreported in most rivalry studies. Is fusion truly a default, stable state that only breaks into rivalry for non-fusible stimuli? Or are monocular and fused percepts three sub-states of one dynamical system? To determine whether fusion and rivalry are separate processes, we measured human perception of Gabor patches with a range of interocular orientation disparities. Observers (10 female, 5 male) reported rivalrous, fused, and uncertain percepts over time. We found a dynamic \"tristable\" zone spanning from ∼25-35° of orientation disparity where fused, left-eye-, or right-eye-dominant percepts could all occur. The temporal characteristics of fusion and non-fusion periods during tristability matched other bistable processes. We tested statistical models with fusion as a higher-level bistable process alternating with rivalry against our findings. None of these fit our data, but a simple bistable model extended to have three states reproduced many of our observations. We conclude that rivalry and fusion are multistable substates capable of direct competition, rather than separate bistable processes.',\n",

Anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging, and optogenetics approaches have established that the auditory cortex (AC) by providing auditory information to the lateral amygdala (LA) via long-range excitatory glutamatergic projections has an impact on sound-driven aversive/fear behavior. Here we test the hypothesis that the LA also receives GABAergic projections from the cortex. We addressed this fundamental question by taking advantage of optogenetics, anatomical, and electrophysiology approaches and directly examining the functional effects of cortical GABAergic inputs to LA neurons of the mouse (male/female) AC. We found that the cortex, via cortico-lateral-amygdala somatostatin neurons (CLA-SOM), has a direct inhibitory influence on the output of the LA principal neurons. Our results define a CLA long-range inhibitory circuit (CLA-SOM inhibitory projections → LA principal neurons) underlying the control of spike timing/generation in LA and LA-AC projecting neurons, and attributes a specific function to a genetically defined type of cortical long-range GABAergic neurons in CLA communication.',\n",
       " 'Neurons in parasubiculum (PaS), presubiculum (PrS), and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) code for place (grid cells) and head direction. Directional input has been shown to be important for stable grid cell properties in MEC, and PaS and PrS have been postulated to provide this information to MEC. In line with this, head direction cells in those brain areas are present at postnatal day 11 (P11), having directional tuning that stabilizes shortly after eye opening, which is before premature grid cells emerge in MEC at P16. Whether functional connectivity between these structures exists at those early postnatal stages is unclear. Using anatomical tracing, voltage-sensitive dye imaging and single-cell patch recordings in female and male rat brain slices between P2 and P61, we determined when the pathways from PaS and PrS to MEC emerge, become functional, and how they develop. Anatomical connections from PaS and PrS to superficial MEC emerge between P4 and P6. Monosynaptic connectivity from PaS and PrS to superficial MEC was measurable from P9 to P10 onward, whereas connectivity with deep MEC was measurable from P11 to P12. From P14/P15 on, reactivity of MEC neurons to parasubicular and presubicular inputs becomes adult-like and continues to develop until P28-P30. The maturation of the efficacy of both inputs between P9 and P21 is paralleled by maturation of morphological properties, changes in intrinsic properties of MEC principal neurons, and changes in the GABAergic network of MEC. In conclusion, synaptic projections from PaS and PrS to MEC become functional and adult-like before the emergence of grid cells in MEC.',\n",
       " 'Previous neuroimaging studies have identified various brain regions that are activated by music listening or recall. However, little is known about how these brain regions represent the time course and temporal features of music during listening and recall. Here we analyzed neural activity in different brain regions associated with music listening and recall using electrocorticography recordings obtained from 10 epilepsy patients of both genders implanted with subdural electrodes. Electrocorticography signals were recorded while subjects were listening to familiar instrumental music or recalling the same music pieces by imagery. During the onset phase (0-500 ms), music listening initiated cortical activity in high-gamma band in the temporal lobe and supramarginal gyrus, followed by the precentral gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, during music recall, the high-gamma band activity first appeared in the inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus, and then spread to the temporal lobe, showing a reversed temporal sequential order. During the sustained phase (after 500 ms), delta band and high-gamma band responses in the supramarginal gyrus, temporal and frontal lobes dynamically tracked the intensity envelope of the music during listening or recall with distinct temporal delays. During music listening, the neural tracking by the frontal lobe lagged behind that of the temporal lobe; whereas during music recall, the neural tracking by the frontal lobe preceded that of the temporal lobe. These findings demonstrate bottom-up and top-down processes in the cerebral cortex during music listening and recall and provide important insights into music processing by the human brain.',\n",
       " 'Anxiety comprises a suite of behaviors to deal with potential threat and is often modeled in approach-avoidance conflict tasks. Collectively, these tests constitute a predominant preclinical model of anxiety disorder. A body of evidence suggests that both ventral hippocampus and amygdala lesions impair anxiety-like behavior, but the relative contribution of these two structures is unclear. A possible reason is that approach-avoidance conflict tasks involve a series of decisions and actions, which may be controlled by distinct neural mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle from behavioral readouts. Here, we capitalize on a human approach-avoidance conflict test, implemented as computer game, that separately measures several action components. We investigate three patients of both sexes with unspecific unilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage, one male with selective bilateral hippocampal (HC), and one female with selective bilateral amygdala lesions, and compare them to matched controls. MTL and selective HC lesions, but not selective amygdala lesions, increased approach decision when possible loss was high. In contrast, MTL and selective amygdala lesions, but not selective HC lesions, increased return latency. Additionally, selective HC and selective amygdala lesions reduced approach latency. In a task targeted at revealing subjective assumptions about the structure of the computer game, MTL and selective HC lesions impacted on reaction time generation but not on the subjective task structure. We conclude that deciding to approach reward under threat relies on hippocampus but not amygdala, whereas vigor of returning to safety depends on amygdala but not on hippocampus.',\n",

Findings from appetitive conditioning studies have shown that basal amygdala is required for behaviors that are sensitive to updates in outcome value, but similar results in aversive motivation are difficult to interpret due to a lack of outcome specificity. The studies reported here sought to develop procedures to isolate sensory-specific processes in aversive learning and behavior and to assess the possible contribution of the basal amygdala. Post-training changes to outcome value produced commensurate changes to subsequently tested conditioned responding in male rodents. Specifically, increases in shock intensity (i.e., inflation) augmented, while repeated exposure to (i.e., habituation of) an aversive sound (klaxon-horn) reduced freezing to conditioned stimuli previously paired with these outcomes. This was extended to a discriminative procedure, in which following revaluation of one event, but not the other, responding was found to be dependent on outcome value signaled by each cue. Chemogenetic inactivation of basal amygdala impaired this discrimination between stimuli signaling differently valued outcomes, but did not affect the revaluation process itself. These findings demonstrate a contribution of the basal amygdala to aversive outcome-dependent motivational processes.',\n",

Such changes in behavior may be desirable when facing transient disturbances, or when unpredictable changes in visual or mechanical properties of the task make it difficult to form an accurate model of the perturbation.

       " 'Heading perception in primates depends heavily on visual optic-flow cues. Yet during self-motion, heading percepts remain stable, even though smooth-pursuit eye movements often distort optic flow. According to theoretical work, self-motion can be represented accurately by compensating for these distortions in two ways: via retinal mechanisms or via extraretinal efference-copy signals, which predict the sensory consequences of movement. Psychophysical evidence strongly supports the efference-copy hypothesis, but physiological evidence remains inconclusive. Neurons that signal the true heading direction during pursuit are found in visual areas of monkey cortex, including the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd). Here we measured heading tuning in MSTd using a novel stimulus paradigm, in which we stabilize the optic-flow stimulus on the retina during pursuit. This approach isolates the effects on neuronal heading preferences of extraretinal signals, which remain active while the retinal stimulus is prevented from changing. Our results from 3 female monkeys demonstrate a significant but small influence of extraretinal signals on the preferred heading directions of MSTd neurons. Under our stimulus conditions, which are rich in retinal cues, we find that retinal mechanisms dominate physiological corrections for pursuit eye movements, suggesting that extraretinal cues, such as predictive efference-copy mechanisms, have a limited role under naturalistic conditions.',\n",
       " \"Phoenix et al. (1959) reported that treating pregnant guinea pigs with testosterone had enduring effects on the sex-related behavior of their female offspring. Since then, similar enduring effects of early testosterone exposure have been found in other species, including humans, and for other behaviors that show average sex differences. In humans, the affected outcomes include gender identity, sexual orientation, and children's sex-typical play behavior. The evidence linking early testosterone exposure to sex-typed play is particularly robust, and sex-typed play is also influenced by many other factors, including socialization by parents and peers and self-socialization, based on cognitive understanding of gender. In addition to influencing behavior, testosterone and hormones produced from testosterone affect mammalian brain structure. Studies using human autopsy material have found some sex differences in the human brain similar to those seen in other species, and have reported that some brain sex differences correlate with sexual orientation or gender identity, although the causes of these brain/behavior relationships are unclear. Studies that have imaged the living human brain have found only a small number of sex differences, and these differences are generally small in magnitude. In addition, they have not been linked to robust psychological or behavioral sex differences. Future research might benefit from improved imaging technology, and attention to other brain characteristics. In addition, it might usefully explore how different types of factors, such as early testosterone exposure and parental socialization, work together in the developmental system that produces sex/gender differences in human brain and behavior.\",\n",

Here, we test whether sensory uncertainty is encoded in cortical population activity as the width of a probability distribution, a hypothesis that lies at the heart of Bayesian models of neural coding. We probe the neural representation of uncertainty by capitalizing on a well-known behavioral bias called serial dependence. Human observers of either sex reported the orientation of stimuli presented in sequence, while activity in visual cortex was measured with fMRI. We decoded probability distributions from population-level activity and found that serial dependence effects in behavior are consistent with a statistically advantageous sensory integration strategy, in which uncertain sensory information is given less weight. More fundamentally, our results suggest that probability distributions decoded from human visual cortex reflect the sensory uncertainty that observers rely on in their decisions, providing critical evidence for Bayesian theories of perception.',\n",

Drugs of abuse also upregulate ΔFosB in hippocampus, but the mechanism of its induction by cocaine and its role in hippocampus-dependent cocaine responses is unknown. We investigated differences in mouse dorsal and ventral hippocampal ΔFosB expression in response to chronic cocaine, because these regions appear to regulate distinct cocaine-related behaviors.

These behavioral differences must be the result of underlying neural differences, but surprisingly, this topic has gone largely unexplored. The current study examined whether and how selective breeding by humans has altered the gross organization of the brain in dogs. We assessed regional volumetric variation in MRI studies of 62 male and female dogs of 33 breeds. Neuroanatomical variation is plainly visible across breeds. This variation is distributed nonrandomly across the brain. A whole-brain, data-driven independent components analysis established that specific regional subnetworks covary significantly with each other. Variation in these networks is not simply the result of variation in total brain size, total body size, or skull shape. Furthermore, the anatomy of these networks correlates significantly with different behavioral specialization(s) such as sight hunting, scent hunting, guarding, and companionship. Importantly, a phylogenetic analysis revealed that most change has occurred in the terminal branches of the dog phylogenetic tree, indicating strong, recent selection in individual breeds. Together, these results establish that brain anatomy varies significantly in dogs, likely due to human-applied selection for behavior.',\n",

Viscerosensory information is conveyed to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) where it initiates neuroendocrine, behavioral, and autonomic reflex responses that ensure optimal internal organ function. This excitatory input is modulated by diverse, local inhibitory interneurons, whose functions are not clearly understood. Here we show that, in male rats, 65% of somatostatin-expressing (SST) NTS neurons also express GAD67, supporting their likely role as inhibitory interneurons. Using whole-cell recordings of NTS neurons, from horizontal brainstem slices of male and female SST-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and SST-channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-YFP mice, we quantified the impact of SST-NTS neurons on viscerosensory processing.

We used random dot stereograms to test for stereopsis in male and female mice, and they were able to discriminate near from far surfaces over a range of disparities, with diminishing performance for small and large binocular disparities. Based on two-photon measurements of disparity tuning, the range of disparities represented in the visual cortex aligns with the behavior and covers a broad range of disparities. When we examined their binocular eye movements, we found that, unlike primates, mice did not systematically vary relative eye positions or use vergence eye movements when presented with different disparities. Nonetheless, the representation of disparity tuning was wide enough to capture stereoscopic information over a range of potential vergence angles. Although mice share fundamental characteristics of stereoscopic vision with primates and carnivores, their lack of disparity-dependent vergence eye movements and wide neuronal representation suggests that they may use a distinct strategy for stereopsis.',\n",

In addition, calyx terminals are morphologically diverse, which impacts vesicle release properties and synaptic plasticity. Mitochondria influence synaptic plasticity through calcium buffering and are crucial for providing the energy required for synaptic transmission. Therefore, it has been postulated that mitochondrial levels increase during development and contribute to the morphological-functional diversity in the mature calyx. However, the developmental profile of mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distribution at the calyx of Held remains unclear. To provide insight on this, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral vector that expresses the genetically encoded peroxidase marker for mitochondria, mito-APEX2, at the mouse calyx of Held. We developed protocols to detect labeled mitochondria for use with serial block face scanning electron microscopy to carry out semiautomated segmentation of mitochondria, high-throughput whole-terminal reconstruction, and presynaptic ultrastructure in mice of either sex. Subsequently, we measured mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distributions at the immature postnatal day (P)7 and the mature (P21) calyx. We found an increase of mitochondria volumes in terminals and axons from P7 to P21 but did not observe differences between stalk and swelling subcompartments in the mature calyx. Based on these findings, we propose that mitochondrial volumes and synaptic localization developmentally increase to support high firing rates required in the initial stages of auditory information processing.',\n",
       " 'Children who survive premature birth often exhibit reductions in hippocampal volumes and deficits in working memory. However, it is unclear whether synaptic plasticity and cellular mechanisms of learning and memory can be elicited or disrupted in the preterm fetal hippocampus. CA1 hippocampal neurons were exposed to two common insults to preterm brain: transient hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and hypoxia (Hx). We used a preterm fetal sheep model using both sexes in twin 0.65 gestation fetuses that reproduces the spectrum of injury and abnormal growth in preterm infants. Using Cavalieri measurements, hippocampal volumes were reduced in both Hx and HI fetuses compared with controls. This volume loss was not the result of neuronal cell death. Instead, morphometrics revealed alterations in both basal and apical dendritic arborization that were significantly associated with the level of systemic hypoxemia and metabolic stress regardless of etiology. Anatomical alterations of CA1 neurons were accompanied by reductions in probability of presynaptic glutamate release, long-term synaptic plasticity and intrinsic excitability. The reduction in intrinsic excitability was in part due to increased activity of the channels underlying the fast and slow component of the afterhyperpolarization in Hx and HI. Our studies suggest that even a single brief episode of hypoxemia can markedly disrupt hippocampal maturation. Hypoxemia may contribute to long-term working memory disturbances in preterm survivors by disrupting neuronal maturation with resultant functional disturbances in hippocampal action potential throughput. Strategies directed at limiting the duration or severity of hypoxemia during brain development may mitigate disturbances in hippocampal maturation.',\n",

We hypothesized that increased inhibitory inputs to the neuronal pathway from the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBNST) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during chronic pain may induce tonic suppression of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. To test this hypothesis, male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to spinal nerve ligation to induce neuropathic pain and then spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) were measured in this neuronal pathway. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of brain slices containing the dlBNST revealed that the frequency of sIPSCs significantly increased in VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons 4 weeks after surgery. Next, the role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling within the dlBNST in the increased sIPSCs was examined. CRF increased the frequency of sIPSCs in VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons in sham-operated controls, but not in chronic pain rats. By contrast, NBI27914, a CRF type 1 receptor antagonist, decreased the frequency of sIPSCs in VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons in the chronic pain rats, but not in the control animals. In addition, histological analyses revealed the increased expression of CRF mRNA in the dlBNST. Finally, bilateral injections of NBI27914 into the dlBNST of chronic pain rats activated mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons and induced conditioned place preference. Together, these results suggest that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is tonically suppressed during chronic pain by enhanced CRF signaling within the dlBNST via increased inhibitory inputs to VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons.',\n",

TS, caused by X-chromosome haploinsufficiency in females, is associated with well-recognized effects on visuospatial processing, parieto-occipital cortical anatomy, and parietal lobe function. However, it is unknown whether these effects are related to altered brain structure and function in early visual areas (V1-V3) versus downstream parietal cortical regions. Results show that girls with TS have the following: (1) smaller volume of V1-V3, (2) lower average pRF eccentricity in early visual areas, and (3) sparser pRF coverage in the periphery of the visual field. Further, we examined whether the lower volume of early visual areas, defined using retinotopic mapping, in TS is due to smaller surface area or thinner cortex. Results show that girls with TS had a general reduction in surface area relative to controls in bilateral V1 and V2. Our data suggest the possibility that the smaller cortical surface area of early visual areas in girls with TS may be associated with a lower number of neurons, which in turn, leads to lesser coverage of the peripheral visual field compared to controls.

However, previous studies were too insensitive to determine whether semantic representations were shared at a fine level of detail rather than merely at a coarse scale. We used fMRI to record brain activity in two separate experiments while participants listened to or read several hours of the same narrative stories, and then created voxelwise encoding models to characterize semantic selectivity in each voxel and in each individual participant. We find that semantic tuning during listening and reading are highly correlated in most semantically selective regions of cortex, and models estimated using one modality accurately predict voxel responses in the other modality.

In this study, we focused on humans' remarkable ability to turn novel instructions into actions. While previous research shows that instruction encoding is tightly linked to proactive activations in frontoparietal brain regions, little is known about the structure that orchestrates such anticipatory representation. We collected fMRI data while participants (both males and females) followed novel complex verbal rules that varied across control-related variables (integrating within/across stimuli dimensions, response complexity, target category) and reward expectations. Using representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), we explored where in the brain these variables explained the organization of novel task encoding, and whether motivation modulated these representational spaces. Instruction representations in the lateral PFC were structured by the three control-related variables, whereas intraparietal sulcus encoded response complexity and the fusiform gyrus and precuneus organized its activity according to the relevant stimulus category. Reward exerted a general effect, increasing the representational similarity among different instructions, which was robustly correlated with behavioral improvements. Overall, our results highlight the flexibility of proactive task encoding, governed by distinct representational organizations in specific brain regions. They also stress the variability of motivation-control interactions, which appear to be highly dependent on task attributes, such as complexity or novelty.\",\n",

During sleep, the activity of these muscles is suppressed, and as a result individuals with obstructive sleep apnea experience repeated episodes of upper airway closure when they are asleep, in particular during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Blocking cholinergic transmission in the hypoglossal motor nucleus (MoXII) restores REM sleep genioglossus activity, highlighting the importance of cholinergic transmission in the inhibition of hypoglossal motor neurons (HMNs) during REM sleep. Glutamatergic afferent input from neurons in the parahypoglossal (PH) region to the HMNs is critical for MoXII respiratory motor output. We hypothesized that state-dependent cholinergic regulation may be mediated by this pathway.

We hypothesized that these descending motor pathways distinctly contribute to the control of a spastic muscle in humans with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). To test this hypothesis, we examined motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the leg representation of the primary motor cortex, maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), and the StartReact response (shortening in reaction time evoked by a startling stimulus) in the quadriceps femoris muscle in male and females with and without incomplete SCI. A total of 66.7% of the SCI participants showed symptoms of spasticity, whereas the other 33.3% showed no or low levels of spasticity. We found that participants with spasticity had smaller MEPs and MVCs and larger StartReact compared with participants with no or low spasticity and control subjects. These results were consistently present in spastic subjects but not in the other populations. Clinical scores of spasticity were negatively correlated with MEP-max and MVC values and positively correlated with shortening in reaction time. These findings provide evidence for lesser corticospinal and larger reticulospinal influences to spastic muscles in humans with SCI and suggest that these imbalanced contributions are important for motor recovery.',\n",
       " 'Homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength allows for maintenance of neural activity within a dynamic range for proper circuit function. There are largely two distinct modes of synaptic plasticity that allow for homeostatic adaptation of cortical circuits: synaptic scaling and sliding threshold (BCM theory). Previous findings suggest that the induction of synaptic scaling is not prevented by blocking NMDARs, whereas the sliding threshold model posits that the synaptic modification threshold of LTP and LTD readjusts with activity and thus the outcome of synaptic plasticity is NMDAR dependent. Although synaptic scaling and sliding threshold have been considered two distinct mechanisms, there are indications from recent studies that these two modes of homeostatic plasticity may interact or that they may operate under two distinct activity regimes. Here, we report using both sexes of mouse that acute genetic knock-out of the obligatory subunit of NMDAR or acute pharmacological block of NMDAR prevents experience-dependent homeostatic regulation of AMPAR-mediated miniature EPSCs in layer 2/3 of visual cortex.

Our findings confirm the ability of the visual system to form such representations both explicitly and implicitly (i.e., with or without the use of specific instructions). We show that summary representations, rather than individual ensemble constituents, can be decoded from neural signals elicited by ensemble perception, we describe the properties of such representations by appeal to multidimensional face space constructs, and we visualize their content through neural-based image reconstruction. Further, we show that the temporal profile of ensemble processing diverges systematically from that of single faces consistent with a slower, more gradual accumulation of perceptual information.

Converging evidence suggest that zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) eliminates memories for experience-dependent behaviors, including conditioned drug associations. However, the effect of ZIP on reward seeking and drug-induced plasticity is unknown. The current study examined the effect of ZIP administration in the nucleus accumbens on reinstatement (RI) of cocaine seeking, a rodent model of relapse. We demonstrate that intra-accumbal ZIP administration blocks cocaine-primed RI in rats when administered 24 h or 1 week before testing. These effects of ZIP on drug seeking are specific, as we did not see any effect of ZIP on RI of sucrose seeking. ZIP is a synthetic compound designed to inhibit the atypical PKC, PKMζ, a protein implicated in learning and memory. However, recent evidence from PKMζ-knock-out (KO) mice suggests that ZIP may function through alternative mechanisms. In support of this, we found that ZIP was able to block cue-induced RI in PKMζ-KO mice. One possible mechanism underlying addictive phenotypes is the ability of cocaine to block further plasticity. We hypothesized that ZIP may be working to reverse this anaplasticity. Although ZIP has no effect on accumbal LTD in slices from naive or yoked saline mice, it is able to restore both NMDA-dependent and mGluR5-dependent LTD in animals after cocaine self-administration and withdrawal. These findings demonstrate that intra-accumbal ZIP persistently reverses cocaine-induced behavioral and synaptic plasticity in male and female rodents.',\n",

       " 'The involvement of fronto-striatal circuits in item and associative memory retrieval as well as in the stabilization of memories by retrieval practice suggests that both retrieval and re-encoding of stored memories might rely on dopaminergic mechanisms in humans. We tested these hypotheses in a placebo-controlled pharmacological fMRI study using 2 mg of the D2 antagonist haloperidol administered acutely before a cued associative recall task of previously encoded picture-word pairs in 53 healthy humans of both sexes. The cued associative recall was moreover repeated 3 d later outside the scanner without pharmacological intervention. Dopaminergic modulation significantly improved associative recall performance and recognition accuracy of verbal items. Moreover, we observed a significant dopamine effect on re-encoding in terms of increased specificity of associative memories from the first to the second cued associative recall. Better association memory under haloperidol was linked with higher activity in the left lateral prefrontal cortex and right parietal cortex, suggesting that dopamine facilitates associative retrieval through increased recruitment of frontoparietal monitoring processes. In contrast, improved recognition of verbal items under haloperidol was reflected by enhanced novelty detection in the hippocampus and increased activity in saliency networks. Together, these results show distinct but concomitant positive effects of dopamine on associative recall and item recognition and suggest that the specificity of associative recall through re-encoding mechanisms is likewise augmented by dopamine.',\n",
       " 'In the trichromatic primate retina, the \"midget\" retinal ganglion cell is the classical substrate for red-green color signaling, with a circuitry that enables antagonistic responses between long (L)- and medium (M)-wavelength-sensitive cone inputs. Previous physiological studies showed that some OFF midget ganglion cells may receive sparse input from short (S)-wavelength-sensitive cones, but the effect of S-cone inputs on the chromatic tuning properties of such cells has not been explored. Moreover, anatomical evidence for a synaptic pathway from S cones to OFF midget ganglion cells through OFF midget bipolar cells remains ambiguous. In this study, we address both questions for the macaque monkey retina. First, we used serial block-face electron microscopy to show that every S cone in the parafoveal retina synapses principally with a single OFF midget bipolar cell, which in turn forms a private-line connection with an OFF midget ganglion cell. Second, we used patch electrophysiology to characterize the chromatic tuning of OFF midget ganglion cells in the near peripheral retina that receive combined input from L, M, and S cones. These \"S-OFF\" midget cells have a characteristic S-cone spatial signature, but demonstrate heterogeneous color properties due to the variable strength of L, M, and S cone input across the receptive field. Together, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the OFF midget pathway is the major conduit for S-OFF signals in primate retina and redefines the pathway as a chromatically complex substrate that encodes color signals beyond the classically recognized L versus M and S versus L+M cardinal mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'Episodic memories typically comprise multiple elements. A defining characteristic of episodic retrieval is holistic recollection, i.e., comprehensive recall of the elements a memorized event encompasses. A recent study implicated activity in the human hippocampus with holistic recollection of multi-element events based on cues (Horner et al., 2015). Here, we obtained ultra-high resolution functional neuroimaging data at 7 tesla in 30 younger adults (12 female) using the same paradigm. In accordance with anatomically inspired computational models and animal research, we found that metabolic activity in hippocampal subfield CA3 (but less pronounced in dentate gyrus) correlated with this form of mnemonic pattern completion across participants. Our study provides the first evidence in humans for a strong involvement of hippocampal subfield CA3 in holistic recollection via pattern completion.',\n",

In a double-blind placebo-controlled human study (30 females, 30 males in total), we show that a memory selectivity bias was insensitive to propranolol but sensitive to amisulpride, consistent with a dominant influence from dopamine. By contrast, a putative arousal-induced memory boosting effect was insensitive to amisulpride but was sensitive to propranolol, consistent with a dominant noradrenaline effect. Thus, our findings highlight specific functional roles for dopamine and noradrenaline neurotransmission in the expression of incidental memory.',\n",

In the decades that followed, their prediction was neglected. The precuneus was found to be involved in numerous motor, cognitive and visual processes, but no work was done on its somatotopic organization. Here, we used a periodic experimental design in which 16 human subjects (eight women) moved 20 body parts to investigate the possible body part topography of the precuneus. We found an anterior-to-posterior, dorsal-to-ventral, toes-to-tongue gradient in a mirror orientation to the SMA. When inspecting body-part-specific functional connectivity, we found differential connectivity patterns for the different body parts to the primary and secondary motor areas and parietal and visual areas, and a shared connectivity to the extrastriate body area, another topographically organized area. We suggest that a whole-body gradient can be found in the precuneus and is connected to multiple brain areas with different connectivity for different body parts. Its exact role and relations to the other known functions of the precuneus such as self-processing, motor imagery, reaching, visuomotor and other body-mind functions should be investigated.',\n",
       " 'Neuroepithelial cell (NEC) elongation is one of several key cell behaviors that mediate the tissue-level morphogenetic movements that shape the neural tube (NT), the precursor of the brain and spinal cord. However, the upstream signals that promote NEC elongation have been difficult to tease apart from those regulating apico-basal polarity and hingepoint formation, due to their confounding interdependence. The Repulsive Guidance Molecule a (Rgma)/Neogenin 1 (Neo1) signaling pathway plays a conserved role in NT formation (neurulation) and is reported to regulate both NEC elongation and apico-basal polarity, through signal transduction events that have not been identified. We examine here the role of Rgma/Neo1 signaling in zebrafish (sex unknown), an organism that does not use hingepoints to shape its hindbrain, thereby enabling a direct assessment of the role of this pathway in NEC elongation. We confirm that Rgma/Neo1 signaling is required for microtubule-mediated NEC elongation, and demonstrate via cell transplantation that Neo1 functions cell autonomously to promote elongation. However, in contrast to previous findings, our data do not support a role for this pathway in establishing apical junctional complexes.

Here, we describe electrophysiological changes in cortical neurons after recovery from hypoxia-induced SD. When examined with standard measures of neuronal excitability several hours after recovery from SD, layer 5 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mice of either sex appear surprisingly normal. However, we here introduce an additional parameter, dynamic gain, which characterizes the bandwidth of action potential encoding by a neuron, and thereby reflects its potential efficiency in a multineuronal circuit.

Whereas a long-standing hypothesis of the aging literature links cognitive impairments to less distinct neural representations in old age (\"neural dedifferentiation\"), memory studies have shown that overlapping neural representations of different studied items are beneficial for memory performance. In an electroencephalography (EEG) study, we addressed the question whether distinctiveness or similarity between patterns of neural activity supports memory differentially in younger and older adults. We analyzed between-item neural pattern similarity in 50 younger (19-27 years old) and 63 older (63-75 years old) male and female human adults who repeatedly studied and recalled scene-word associations using a mnemonic imagery strategy. We compared the similarity of spatiotemporal EEG frequency patterns during initial encoding in relation to subsequent recall performance. The within-person association between memory success and pattern similarity differed between age groups: For older adults, better memory performance was linked to higher similarity early in the encoding trials, whereas young adults benefited from lower similarity between earlier and later periods during encoding, which might reflect their better success in forming unique memorable mental images of the joint picture-word pairs. Our results advance the understanding of the representational properties that give rise to subsequent memory, as well as how these properties may change in the course of aging.',\n",
       " 'Reorganization of residual descending motor circuits underlies poststroke recovery. We previously clarified a causal relationship between the cortico-rubral tract and intensive limb use-induced functional recovery after internal capsule hemorrhage (ICH). However, other descending tracts, such as the cortico-reticular tract, might also be involved in rehabilitation-induced compensation. To investigate whether rehabilitation-induced recovery after ICH involves a shift in the compensatory circuit from the cortico-rubral tract to the cortico-reticular tract, we established loss of function of the cortico-rubral tract or/and cortico-reticular tract using two sets of viral vectors comprising the Tet-on system and designer receptors exclusively activated by the designer drug system. We used an ICH model that destroyed almost 60% of the corticofugal fibers. Anterograde tracing in rehabilitated rats revealed abundant sprouting of axons from the motor cortex in the red nucleus but not in the medullary reticular formation during the early phase of recovery. This primary contribution of the cortico-rubral tract was demonstrated by its selective blockade, whereas selective cortico-reticular tract silencing had little effect. Interestingly, cortico-rubral tract blockade from the start of rehabilitation induced an obvious increase of axon sprouting in the reticular formation with substantial functional recovery. Additional cortico-reticular tract silencing under the cortico-rubral tract blockade significantly worsened the recovered forelimb function. Furthermore, the alternative recruitment of the cortico-reticular tract was gradually induced by intensive limb use under cortico-rubral tract blockade, in which cortico-reticular tract silencing caused an apparent motor deficit. These findings indicate that individual cortico-brainstem pathways have dynamic compensatory potency to support rehabilitative functional recovery after ICH.',\n",

       " 'Complex neural circuits are built from axonal branches that allow each neuron to connect with multiple targets. During development, maturation of nascent branches depends on stabilization of newly assembled or transported microtubules, which are thought to be regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). However, because many known MAPs inhibit branch formation, it is not clear which MAP is responsible for regulating microtubule stability during branch development. Here, we show that MAP7, a less-well understood MAP that is localized to branch junctions, provides a key molecular mechanism to regulate microtubule stability during branch formation. In developing rodent sensory neurons of mixed sex, MAP7 is required for branch maturation mainly by preventing branch retraction. This function is mediated by the ability of MAP7 to control microtubule stability, as microtubules are more stable at branch junctions where MAP7 is localized. Consistently, nascent branches depleted of MAP7 have decreased stable microtubules but increased dynamic microtubules. Moreover, MAP7 binds to the acetylated and stable region of individual microtubules and avoids the dynamic plus end, thereby creating a boundary that prevents microtubule depolymerization and rescues microtubule polymerization. This unique binding property, which is not observed for other MAPs, can prevent branch retraction caused by laser-induced severing or nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization. Together, our study identifies a novel molecular mechanism mediated by MAP7 to regulate microtubule stability and strengthen branches at different stages of axonal branch morphogenesis.',\n",

Animal studies have shown that maternal undernutrition leads to behavioral impairment, which is linked to alterations in monoaminergic systems and inflammation in the brain. In this study, we focused on the ethanolamine plasmalogen of the brain as a possible contributor to behavioral disturbances observed in offspring exposed to maternal undernutrition. Maternal food or protein restriction between gestational day (GD) 5.5 and GD 10.5 resulted in hyperactivity of rat male adult offspring. Genes related to the phospholipid biosynthesis were found to be activated in the PFC, but not in the NAcc or striatum, in the offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition. Corresponding to these gene activations, increased ethanolamine plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) was observed in the PFC using mass spectrometry imaging. A high number of crossings and the long time spent in the center area were observed in the offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition and were mimicked in adult rats via the intravenous injection of ethanolamine plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) incorporated into the liposome. Additionally, plasmalogen (18:0p-22:6) increased only in the PFC, and not in the NAcc or striatum.

       " 'In visual search, the presence of a salient, yet task-irrelevant, distractor in the stimulus array interferes with target selection and slows down performance. Neuroimaging data point to a key role of the frontoparietal dorsal attention network in dealing with visual distractors; however, the respective roles of different nodes within the network and their hemispheric specialization are still unresolved. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to evaluate the causal role of two key regions of the dorsal attention network in resisting attentional capture by a salient singleton distractor: the frontal eye field (FEF) and the cortex within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The task of the participants (male/female human volunteers) was to discriminate the pointing direction of a target arrow while ignoring a task-irrelevant salient distractor. Immediately after stimulus onset, triple-pulse 10 Hz TMS was delivered either to IPS or FEF on either side of the brain. Results indicated that TMS over the right FEF significantly reduced the behavioral cost engendered by the salient distractor relative to left FEF stimulation. No such effect was obtained with stimulation of IPS on either side of brain. Interestingly, this FEF-dependent reduction in distractor interference interacted with the contingent trial history, being maximal when no distractor was present on the previous trial relative to when there was one. Our results provide direct causal evidence that the right FEF houses key mechanisms for distractor filtering, pointing to a pivotal role of the frontal cortex of the right hemisphere in limiting interference from an irrelevant but attention-grabbing stimulus.',\n",
       " 'Cortical responses to repeated presentations of a sensory stimulus are variable. This variability is sensitive to several stimulus dimensions, suggesting that it may carry useful information beyond the average firing rate. Many experimental manipulations that affect response variability are also known to engage divisive normalization, a widespread operation that describes neuronal activity as the ratio of a numerator (representing the excitatory stimulus drive) and denominator (the normalization signal). Although it has been suggested that normalization affects response variability, we lack a quantitative framework to determine the relation between the two. Here we extend the standard normalization model, by treating the numerator and the normalization signal as variable quantities. The resulting model predicts a general stabilizing effect of normalization on neuronal responses, and allows us to infer the single-trial normalization strength, a quantity that cannot be measured directly. We test the model on neuronal responses to stimuli of varying contrast, recorded in primary visual cortex of male macaques. We find that neurons that are more strongly normalized fire more reliably, and response variability and pairwise noise correlations are reduced during trials in which normalization is inferred to be strong. Our results thus suggest a novel functional role for normalization, namely, modulating response variability. Our framework could enable a direct quantification of the impact of single-trial normalization strength on the accuracy of perceptual judgments, and can be readily applied to other sensory and nonsensory factors.',\n",

Much debate surrounds the issue of whether or not prior knowledge feeds back to affect early auditory encoding in the lower levels of the speech processing hierarchy, or whether perception can be best explained as a purely feedforward process. Although there has been compelling evidence on both sides of this debate, experiments involving naturalistic speech stimuli to address these questions have been lacking. Here, we use a recently introduced method for quantifying the semantic context of speech and relate it to a commonly used method for indexing low-level auditory encoding of speech. The relationship between these measures is taken to be an indication of how semantic context leading up to a word influences how its low-level acoustic and phonetic features are processed. We record EEG from human participants (both male and female) listening to continuous natural speech and find that the early cortical tracking of a word's speech envelope is enhanced by its semantic similarity to its sentential context. Using a forward modeling approach, we find that prediction accuracy of the EEG signal also shows the same effect. Furthermore, this effect shows distinct temporal patterns of correlation depending on the type of speech input representation (acoustic or phonological) used for the model, implicating a top-down propagation of information through the processing hierarchy. These results suggest a mechanism that links top-down prior information with the early cortical entrainment of words in natural, continuous speech.\",\n",

In Part 1, recent data on gaps in representation, compensation, and recognition (awards, grants, publications) are reviewed, highlighting differences across subfields (e.g., computer science vs biology) and across career trajectories (e.g., bachelor's degrees vs senior faculty). In Part 2, evidence on leading explanations for these gaps, including explanations centered on abilities, preferences, and explicit and implicit bias, is presented. Particular attention is paid to implicit bias: mental processes that exist largely outside of conscious awareness and control in both male and female perceivers and female targets themselves. Given its prevalence and persistence, implicit bias warrants a central focus for research and application. Finally, in Part 3, the current knowledge is presented on interventions to change individuals' beliefs and behaviors, as well as organizational culture and practices.

Forty-five percent of the TANs use temporally modulated activity to encode information about discounted value. These responses were significantly better represented using principal component analysis than by just counting spikes. The temporal coding is straightforward: the spikes are distributed according to a sinusoidal envelope of activity that changes gain, ranging from positive to negative according to discounted value. Our results show that the information about the relative value of an offered reward is temporally encoded in neural spike trains of TANs. This temporal coding may allow well tuned, coordinated behavior to emerge.',\n",
       " 'The regulation of the striatum by the GPCR signaling through neuromodulators is essential for its physiology and physiopathology, so it is necessary to know all the compounds of these pathways. In this study, we identified a new important partner of the dopaminergic pathway: GPRIN3 (a member of the GPRIN family). GPRIN3 is highly expressed in the striatum but with undefined function. Cell sorting of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in indirect MSNs and direct MSNs indicated the presence of the GPRIN3 gene in both populations with a preferential expression in indirect MSNs. This led us to generate GPRIN3 KO mice by CRISPR/Cas9 and test male animals to access possible alterations in morphological, electrophysiological, and behavioral parameters following its absence. 3D reconstruction analysis of MSNs revealed increased neuronal arborization in GPRIN3 KO and modified passive and active electrophysiological properties. These cellular alterations were coupled with increased motivation and cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion. Additionally, using a specific indirect MSN knockdown, we showed a preferential role for GPRIN3 in indirect MSNs related to the D',\n",
       " 'We investigated the relationship between neurochemical and hemodynamic responses as a function of image contrast in the human primary visual cortex (V1). Simultaneously acquired BOLD-fMRI and single voxel proton MR spectroscopy signals were measured in V1 of 24 healthy human participants of either sex at 7 tesla field strength, in response to presentations (64 s blocks) of different levels of image contrast (3%, 12.5%, 50%, 100%). Our results suggest that complementary measures of neurotransmission and energy metabolism are in partial agreement: BOLD and glutamate signals were linear with image contrast; however, a significant increase in glutamate concentration was evident only at the highest intensity level. In contrast, GABA signals were steady across all intensity levels. These results suggest that neurochemical concentrations are maintained at lower ranges of contrast levels, which match the statistics of natural vision, and that high stimulus intensity may be critical to increase sensitivity to visually modulated glutamate signals in the early visual cortex using MR spectroscopy.',\n",
       " 'Both the global neuronal workspace (GNW) and integrated information theory (IIT) posit that highly complex and interconnected networks engender perceptual awareness. GNW specifies that activity recruiting frontoparietal networks will elicit a subjective experience, whereas IIT is more concerned with the functional architecture of networks than with activity within it. Here, we argue that according to IIT mathematics, circuits converging on integrative versus convergent yet non-integrative neurons should support a greater degree of consciousness. We test this hypothesis by analyzing a dataset of neuronal responses collected simultaneously from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and ventral premotor cortex (vPM) in nonhuman primates presented with auditory, tactile, and audio-tactile stimuli as they are progressively anesthetized with propofol. We first describe the multisensory (audio-tactile) characteristics of S1 and vPM neurons (mean and dispersion tendencies, as well as noise-correlations), and functionally label these neurons as convergent or integrative according to their spiking responses. Then, we characterize how these different pools of neurons behave as a function of consciousness. At odds with the IIT mathematics, results suggest that convergent neurons more readily exhibit properties of consciousness (neural complexity and noise correlation) and are more impacted during the loss of consciousness than integrative neurons. Last, we provide support for the GNW by showing that neural ignition (i.e., same trial coactivation of S1 and vPM) was more frequent in conscious than unconscious states. Overall, we contrast GNW and IIT within the same single-unit activity dataset, and support the GNW.',\n",
       " \"The oxidative metabolism of dopamine and consequent oxidative stress are implicated in dopaminergic neuronal loss, mediating the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The inducible detoxifying antioxidative enzyme Quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) (NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1), neuroprotective to counteract reactive oxidative species, is most prominent in the active stage of the disease and virtually absent at the end stage of the disease. However, the molecular mechanism dictating NQO1 expression oscillation remains unclear. Here we show that Akt phosphorylates NQO1 at T128 residues and triggers its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, abrogating its antioxidative effects in PD. Akt binds NQO1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Interestingly, Akt, but not PINK1, provokes NQO1 phosphorylation and polyubiquitination with Parkin as an E3 ligase. Unphosphorylatable NQO1 mutant displays more robust neuroprotective activity than WT NQO1 in suppressing reactive oxidative species and against MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell death, rescuing the motor disorders in both α-synuclein transgenic transgenic male and female mice elicited by the neurotoxin. Thus, our findings demonstrate that blockade of Akt-mediated NQO1 degradation may ameliorate PD pathogenesis.\",\n",
       " 'In macaque visual cortex, different cytochrome oxidase stripes of area V2 receive segregated projections from layers (L)2/3 and 4B of the primary visual cortex (V1), and project to dorsal or ventral stream extrastriate areas. Parallel V1-to-V2 pathways suggest functionally specialized circuits, but it is unknown whether these circuits arise from distinct cell types. V1 L4B includes two morphological types of excitatory projection neurons: pyramids, which carry mixed magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) information to downstream areas, and spiny stellates, which carry only M information. Previous studies have shown that, overall, V2 receives ∼80% of its L4B inputs from pyramids, thus receiving mixed M and P signals. However, it is unknown how pyramids and stellates distribute their outputs to the different V2 stripes, and whether different stripes receive inputs from morphologically distinct neuron types. Using viral-mediated labeling of V2-projecting L4B neurons in male macaques, we show that thick stripes receive a greater contribution of L4B inputs from M-dominated spiny stellates compared with thin stripes. Both stripe types, however, receive a much larger contribution from spiny stellates than previously shown for V2 overall, indicating that a larger amount of M information than previously thought flows into both the dorsal and ventral streams via the V2 thick and thin stripes, respectively. Moreover, we identify four types of V2-projecting L4B cells differing in size and complexity. Three such cell types project to both thin and thick stripes, but one type, the giant spiny-stellate neuron, resembling L4B neurons projecting to motion-sensitive area MT, was only found to project to thick stripes.',\n",

       " 'Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited intellectual impairment that results from the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA binding protein that regulates mRNA translation at synapses. The absence of FMRP leads to neuronal and circuit-level hyperexcitability that is thought to arise from the aberrant expression and activity of voltage-gated ion channels, although the identification and characterization of these ion channels have been limited. Here, we show that FMRP binds the mRNA of the R-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav2.3 in mouse brain synaptoneurosomes and represses Cav2.3 translation under basal conditions. Consequently, in hippocampal neurons from male and female FMRP KO mice, we find enhanced Cav2.3 protein expression by western blotting and abnormally large R currents in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. In agreement with previous studies showing that FMRP couples Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (GpI mGluR) signaling to protein translation, we find that GpI mGluR stimulation results in increased Cav2.3 translation and R current in hippocampal neurons which is disrupted in FMRP KO mice. Thus, FMRP serves as a key translational regulator of Cav2.3 expression under basal conditions and in response to GpI mGluR stimulation. Loss of regulated Cav2.3 expression could underlie the neuronal hyperactivity and aberrant calcium spiking in FMRP KO mice and contribute to FXS, potentially serving as a novel target for future therapeutic strategies.',\n",

Despite a growing amount of evidence concerning both spike-count and subthreshold membrane potential pairwise correlations, little is known about how different types of cortical neurons convert correlated inputs into correlated outputs. We studied pyramidal neurons and two classes of GABAergic interneurons of layer 5 in neocortical brain slices obtained from rats of both sexes, and we stimulated them with biophysically realistic correlated inputs, generated using dynamic clamp. We found that the physiological differences between cell types manifested unique features in their capacity to transfer correlated inputs. We used linear response theory and computational modeling to gain clear insights into how cellular properties determine both the gain and timescale of correlation transfer, thus tying single-cell features with network interactions. Our results provide further ground for the functionally distinct roles played by various types of neuronal cells in the cortical microcircuit.',\n",

       " 'In primates, working memory function depends on activity in a distributed network of cortical areas that display different patterns of delay task-related activity. These differences are correlated with, and might depend on, distinctive properties of the neurons located in each area. For example, layer 3 pyramidal neurons (L3PNs) differ significantly between primary visual and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices. However, to what extent L3PNs differ between DLPFC and other association cortical areas is less clear. Hence, we compared the properties of L3PNs in monkey DLPFC versus posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a key node in the cortical working memory network. Using patch-clamp recordings and biocytin cell filling in acute brain slices, we assessed the physiology and morphology of L3PNs from monkey DLPFC and PPC. The L3PN transcriptome was studied using laser microdissection combined with DNA microarray or quantitative PCR. We found that in both DLPFC and PPC, L3PNs were divided into regular spiking (RS-L3PNs) and bursting (B-L3PNs) physiological subtypes. Whereas regional differences in single-cell excitability were modest, B-L3PNs were rare in PPC (RS-L3PN:B-L3PN, 94:6), but were abundant in DLPFC (50:50), showing greater physiological diversity. Moreover, DLPFC L3PNs display larger and more complex basal dendrites with higher dendritic spine density. Additionally, we found differential expression of hundreds of genes, suggesting a transcriptional basis for the differences in L3PN phenotype between DLPFC and PPC. These data show that the previously observed differences between DLPFC and PPC neuron activity during working memory tasks are associated with diversity in the cellular/molecular properties of L3PNs.',\n",
       " 'Directing attention helps to extract relevant information and suppress distracters. Alpha brain oscillations (8-12 Hz) are crucial for this process, with power decreases facilitating processing of important information and power increases inhibiting brain regions processing irrelevant information. Evidence for this phenomenon arises from visual attention studies (Worden et al., 2000); however, the effect also exists in other modalities, including the somatosensory system (Haegens et al., 2011) and intersensory attention tasks (Foxe and Snyder, 2011). We investigated in human participants (10 females, 10 males) the role of alpha oscillations in focused (0/100%) versus divided (40/60%) attention, both across modalities (visual/somatosensory; Experiment 1) and within the same modality (visual domain: across hemifields; Experiment 2) while recording EEG over 128 scalp electrodes. In Experiment 1, participants divided their attention between visual and somatosensory modality to determine the temporal/spatial frequency of a target stimulus (vibrotactile stimulus/Gabor grating). In Experiment 2, participants divided attention between two visual hemifields to identify the orientation of a Gabor grating. In both experiments, prestimulus alpha power in visual areas decreased linearly with increasing attention to visual stimuli. In contrast, prestimulus alpha power in parietal areas was lower when attention was divided between modalities/hemifields compared with focused attention. These results suggest there are two alpha sources, one of which reflects the \"visual spotlight of attention\" and the other reflects attentional effort. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that attention recruits two spatially distinct alpha sources in occipital and parietal brain regions, acting simultaneously but serving different functions in attention.',\n",

Efforts to chart neurodevelopmental changes in emotion have been severely hampered by narrowly focused approaches centered on activation of individual brain regions and small sample sizes. Here we investigate the maturation of human functional brain circuits associated with identification of fearful, angry, sad, happy, and neutral faces using a large sample of 759 children, adolescents, and adults (ages 8-23; female/male = 419/340). Network analysis of emotion-related brain circuits revealed three functional modules, encompassing lateral frontoparietal, medial prefrontal-posterior cingulate, and subcortical-posterior insular cortices, with hubs in medial prefrontal, but not posterior cingulate, cortex. This overall network architecture was stable by age 8, and it anchored maturation of circuits important for salience detection and cognitive control, as well as dissociable circuit patterns across distinct emotion categories. Our findings point to similarities and differences in functional circuits associated with identification of fearful, angry, sad, happy, and neutral faces, and reveal aspects of brain circuit organization underlying emotion perception that are stable over development as well as features that change with age. Reliability analyses demonstrated the robustness of our findings and highlighted the importance of large samples for probing functional brain circuit development. Our study emphasizes a need to focus beyond amygdala circuits and provides a robust neurodevelopmental template for investigating emotion perception and identification in psychopathology.',\n",

The PPC neuronal circuitry could thus encode and potentially integrate incoming somatosensory information and whisker motor output. However, the information encoded across PPC layers during refined sensorimotor behavior remains largely unknown. To uncover the sensorimotor features represented in PPC during voluntary whisking and object touch, we performed loose-patch single-unit recordings and extracellular recordings of ensemble activity, covering all layers of PPC in anesthetized and awake, behaving male rats. First, using single-cell receptive field mapping, we revealed the presence of coarse somatotopy along the mediolateral axis in PPC. Second, we found that spiking activity was modulated during exploratory whisking in layers 2-4 and layer 6, but not in layer 5 of awake, behaving rats. Population spiking activity preceded actual movement, and whisker trajectory endpoints could be decoded by population spiking, suggesting that PPC is involved in movement planning. Finally, population spiking activity further increased in response to active whisker touch but only in PPC layers 2-4. Thus, we find layer-specific processing, which emphasizes the computational role of PPC during whisker sensorimotor behavior.',\n",

Here, we examined whether these opposing memories are encoded by distinct neuronal ensembles within the vmPFC with different outputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in male and female rats. Using cocaine self-administration (3 h/d for 14 d) and extinction procedures, we demonstrated that vmPFC was similarly activated (indexed by Fos) during cocaine-seeking tests after 0 (no-extinction) or 7 extinction sessions. Selective Daun02 lesioning of the self-administration ensemble (no-extinction) decreased cocaine seeking, whereas Daun02 lesioning of the extinction ensemble increased cocaine seeking. Retrograde tracing with fluorescent cholera toxin subunit B injected into NAc combined with Fos colabeling in vmPFC indicated that vmPFC self-administration ensembles project to NAc core while extinction ensembles project to NAc shell. Functional disconnection experiments (Daun02 lesioning of vmPFC and acute dopamine D1-receptor blockade with SCH39166 in NAc core or shell) confirm that vmPFC ensembles interact with NAc core versus shell to play dissociable roles in cocaine self-administration versus extinction, respectively. Our results demonstrate that neuronal ensembles mediating cocaine self-administration and extinction comingle in vmPFC but have distinct outputs to the NAc core and shell that promote or inhibit cocaine seeking.',\n",
       " \"In blood, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a component of circulating lipoproteins and mediates the clearance of these lipoproteins from blood by binding to ApoE receptors. Humans express three genetic ApoE variants, ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, which exhibit distinct ApoE receptor-binding properties and differentially affect Alzheimer's disease (AD), such that ApoE2 protects against, and ApoE4 predisposes to AD. In brain, ApoE-containing lipoproteins are secreted by activated astrocytes and microglia, but their functions and role in AD pathogenesis are largely unknown. Ample evidence suggests that ApoE4 induces microglial dysregulation and impedes Aβ clearance in AD, but the direct neuronal effects of ApoE variants are poorly studied. Extending previous studies, we here demonstrate that the three ApoE variants differentially activate multiple neuronal signaling pathways and regulate synaptogenesis. Specifically, using human neurons (male embryonic stem cell-derived) cultured in the absence of glia to exclude indirect glial mechanisms, we show that ApoE broadly stimulates signal transduction cascades. Among others, such stimulation enhances APP synthesis and synapse formation with an ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2 potency rank order, paralleling the relative risk for AD conferred by these ApoE variants.

A better understanding of LS neurophysiology and its functional output is therefore important to assess LS involvement in regulating aggression. The LS is a heterogeneous structure that maintains inputs and outputs with multiple brain regions, and is also divided into subregions that innervate one another. Thus, it is challenging to identify the exact cell type and projections for characterization. In this study, we determined the expression pattern of the calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16B, in the LS of both male and female mice. We then investigated the physiological contribution of the calcium-activated chloride channel to LS neuronal signaling. By performing whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we showed that TMEM16B alters neurotransmitter release at the hippocampal-LS synapse, and regulates spike frequency and spike frequency adaptation in subpopulations of LS neurons. We further demonstrated that loss of TMEM16B function promotes lengthened displays of aggressive behaviors by male mice during the resident intruder paradigm. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TMEM16B function contributes to neuronal excitability in subpopulations of LS neurons and the regulation of aggression in male mice.',\n",

Using rodent models of mTLE, many studies including work from our laboratory have shown that new neurons born around the onset of severe acute seizures known as status epilepticus (SE) are crucial for the process of epileptogenesis and targeting seizure-induced neurogenesis either genetically or pharmacologically can impact the frequency of chronic seizures. However, these studies are limited in their clinical relevance as none of them determines the potential of blocking new neurons generated after the epileptogenic insult to alleviate the development of chronic seizures. Therefore, using a pilocarpine-induced SE model of mTLE in mice of either sex, we show that >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis after SE can reduce the formation of spontaneous recurrent seizures by 65%. We also found that blocking post-SE neurogenesis does not lead to long-term seizure reduction as the effect was observed only transiently for 10 d with >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis. Thus, these findings provide evidence that seizure-induced neurogenesis when adequately reduced in a clinically relevant time period has the potential to transiently suppress recurrent seizures, but additional mechanisms need to be targeted to permanently prevent epilepsy development.',\n",

Here, we use genetic mouse models to demonstrate a role of RGS4 in the maintenance of chronic pain states in male and female mice. Using paradigms of peripheral inflammation and nerve injury, we show that the prevention of RGS4 action leads to recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia and increases the motivation for wheel running. Similarly, RGS4KO eliminates the duration of nocifensive behavior in the second phase of the formalin assay. Using the Complete Freud's Adjuvant (CFA) model of hindpaw inflammation we also demonstrate that downregulation of RGS4 in the adult ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei promotes recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia. RNA sequencing analysis of thalamus (THL) from RGS4WT and RGS4KO mice points to many signal transduction modulators and transcription factors that are uniquely regulated in CFA-treated RGS4WT cohorts. Ingenuity pathway analysis suggests that several components of glutamatergic signaling are differentially affected by CFA treatment between RGS4WT and RGS4KO groups. Notably, Western blot analysis shows increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 in THL synaptosomes of RGS4KO mice at time points at which they recover from mechanical allodynia. Overall, our study provides information on a novel intracellular pathway that contributes to the maintenance of chronic pain states and points to RGS4 as a potential therapeutic target.\",\n",

To unmask possible mechanisms associated with this phenomenon, we asked whether the intrinsic membrane properties in hippocampal neurons were altered as a consequence of early life inflammation. C57BL/6 mice were bred in-house and both male and female pups from multiple litters were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 μg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle at postnatal day (P)14, and kept until adolescence (P35-P45) or adulthood (P60-P70), when brain slices were prepared for whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In neurons of adult male mice pretreated with LPS, the number of action potentials elicited by depolarizing current pulses was significantly increased compared with control neurons, concomitant with increased input resistance, and a lower action potential threshold. Although these changes were not associated with changes in relevant sodium channel expression or differences in capacitance or dendritic architecture, they were linked to a mechanism involving intracellular chloride overload, revealed through a depolarized GABA reversal potential and increased expression of the chloride transporter, NKCC1. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in neurons of adult female mice pretreated with LPS, nor in adolescent mice of either sex. These data uncover a potential mechanism involving neonatal inflammation-induced plasticity in chloride homeostasis, which may contribute to early life inflammation-induced behavioral alterations.',\n",

We had 49 human participants (27 male) execute goal-directed reaches with visual feedback of their hand presented as a cursor. On random trials, the cursor jumped laterally to the reach direction, and thus, required a correction to attain the goal. The first experiment demonstrated that the response amplitude starting at 90 ms scaled with jump magnitude, but only for jumps <2 cm. For larger jumps, the duration of the muscle response scaled with the jump size starting after 120 ms. The second experiment demonstrated that the early response was sensitive to goal redundancy as wider targets evoked a smaller corrective response. The third experiment demonstrated that the early response did not consider the presence of obstacles, as this response routinely drove participants directly to the goal even though this path was blocked by an obstacle. Instead, the appropriate muscle response to navigate around the obstacle started after 120 ms.

Moreover, heterosynaptic changes can accompany homosynaptic plasticity induced in inhibitory neurons by conventional spike-timing-dependent plasticity protocols.

To address this question, we generated male and female transgenic mice wherein a disrupted cGMP-gated channel (CNG) gene can be repaired at the endogenous locus and at different stages of degeneration by tamoxifen-inducible cre-mediated recombination. In normal rods, light-induced closure of CNG channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell, reducing neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Similarly, rods lacking CNG channels exhibit a resting membrane potential that was ~10 mV hyperpolarized compared to WT rods, indicating diminished glutamate release. Retinas from these mice undergo stereotypic retinal remodeling as a consequence of rod malfunction and degeneration. Upon tamoxifen-induced expression of CNG channels, rods recovered their structure and exhibited normal light responses. Moreover, we show that the adult mouse retina displays a surprising degree of plasticity upon activation of rod input. Wayward bipolar cell dendrites establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity extending beyond the developmental period and support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod degeneration.',\n",
       " 'Time locking between neocortical sleep slow oscillations, thalamo-cortical spindles, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples has convincingly been shown to be a key element of systems consolidation. Here we investigate the role of monosynaptic projections from ventral/intermediate hippocampus to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in sleep-dependent memory consolidation in male mice. Following acquisition learning in the Barnes maze, we optogenetically silenced the axonal terminals of hippocampal projections within mPFC during slow-wave sleep. This silencing during SWS selectively impaired recent but not remote memory in the absence of effects on error rate and escape latencies. Furthermore, it prevented the development of the most efficient search strategy and sleep spindle time-locking to slow oscillation. An increase in post-learning sleep sharp-wave ripple (SPWR) density and reduced time locking of learning-associated SPWR activity to sleep spindles may be a less specific response. Our results demonstrate that monosynaptic projections from hippocampus to mPFC contribute to sleep-dependent memory consolidation, potentially by affecting the temporal coupling of sleep-associated electrophysiological events.',\n",
       " \"A group of vestibular afferent nerve fibers with irregular-firing resting discharges are thought to play a prominent role in responses to fast head movements and vestibular plasticity. We show that, in C57BL/6 mice (either sex, 4-5 weeks old), normal activity in the efferent vestibular pathway is required for function of these irregular afferents. Thermal inhibition of efferent fibers results in a profound inhibition of irregular afferents' resting discharges, rendering them inadequate for signaling head movements. In this way, efferent inputs adjust the contribution of the peripheral irregular afferent pathway that plays a critical role in peripheral vestibular signaling and plasticity.\",\n",
       " 'Speech intelligibility can vary dramatically between individuals with similar clinically defined severity of hearing loss based on the audiogram. These perceptual differences, despite equal audiometric-threshold elevation, are often assumed to reflect central-processing variations. Here, we compared peripheral-processing in auditory nerve (AN) fibers of male chinchillas between two prevalent hearing loss etiologies: metabolic hearing loss (MHL) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). MHL results from age-related reduction of the endocochlear potential due to atrophy of the stria vascularis. MHL in the present study was induced using furosemide, which provides a validated model of age-related MHL in young animals by reversibly inhibiting the endocochlear potential. Effects of MHL on peripheral processing were assessed using Wiener-kernel (system identification) analyses of single AN fiber responses to broadband noise, for direct comparison to previously published AN responses from animals with NIHL. Wiener-kernel analyses show that even mild NIHL causes grossly abnormal coding of low-frequency stimulus components. In contrast, for MHL the same abnormal coding was only observed with moderate to severe loss. For equal sensitivity loss, coding impairment was substantially less severe with MHL than with NIHL, probably due to greater preservation of the tip-to-tail ratio of cochlear frequency tuning with MHL compared with NIHL rather than different intrinsic AN properties. Differences in peripheral neural coding between these two pathologies-the more severe of which, NIHL, is preventable-likely contribute to individual speech perception differences. Our results underscore the need to minimize noise overexposure and for strategies to personalize diagnosis and treatment for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.',\n",
       " 'It is well known that attention can facilitate performance by top-down biasing processing of task-relevant information in advance. Recent findings from behavioral studies suggest that distractor inhibition is not under similar direct control but strongly dependent on expectations derived from previous experience. Yet, how expectations about distracting information influence distractor inhibition at the neural level remains unclear. The current study addressed this outstanding question in three experiments in which search displays with repeating distractor or target locations across trials allowed human observers (male and female) to learn which location to selectively suppress or boost. Behavioral findings demonstrated that both distractor and target location learning resulted in more efficient search, as indexed by faster response times. Crucially, distractor learning benefits were observed without target location foreknowledge, unaffected by the number of possible target locations, and could not be explained by priming alone. To determine how distractor location expectations facilitated performance, we applied a spatial encoding model to EEG data to reconstruct activity in neural populations tuned to distractor or target locations. Target location learning increased neural tuning to target locations in advance, indicative of preparatory biasing. This sensitivity increased after target presentation. By contrast, distractor expectations did not change preparatory spatial tuning. Instead, distractor expectations reduced distractor-specific processing, as reflected in the disappearance of the Pd event-related potential component, a neural marker of distractor inhibition, and decreased decoding accuracy. These findings suggest that the brain may no longer process expected distractors as distractors, once it has learned they can safely be ignored.',\n",
       " 'The ability of neural networks to associate successive states of network activity lies at the basis of many cognitive functions. Hence, we hypothesized that many ubiquitous structural and dynamical properties of local cortical networks result from associative learning. To test this hypothesis, we trained recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons on memories composed of varying numbers of associations and compared the resulting network properties with those observed experimentally. We show that, when the network is robustly loaded with near-maximum amount of associations it can support, it develops properties that are consistent with the observed probabilities of excitatory and inhibitory connections, shapes of connection weight distributions, overexpression of specific 2- and 3-neuron motifs, distributions of connection numbers in clusters of 3-8 neurons, sustained, irregular, and asynchronous firing activity, and balance of excitation and inhibition. In addition, memories loaded into the network can be retrieved, even in the presence of noise that is comparable with the baseline variations in the postsynaptic potential. The confluence of these results suggests that many structural and dynamical properties of local cortical networks are simply a byproduct of associative learning. We predict that overexpression of excitatory-excitatory bidirectional connections observed in many cortical systems must be accompanied with underexpression of bidirectionally connected inhibitory-excitatory neuron pairs.',\n",

They are progressively refined to create diverse sensitivity and selectivity for neurons along ascending central pathways. However, the neural circuitry mechanisms have not been directly determined for such fundamental qualities in relation to sensory neurons' functional organizations, because of the technical difficulty of correlating neurons' input and output. Here, we obtained spike outputs and synaptic inputs from the same neurons within characteristically defined neural ensembles, to determine the synaptic mechanisms driving their diverse frequency selectivity in the mouse inferior colliculus. We find that the synaptic strength and timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs are configured differently and independently within individual neurons' receptive fields, which segregate sensitive and selective neurons and endow neural populations with broad receptive fields and sharp frequency tuning. By computationally modeling spike outputs from integrating synaptic inputs and comparing them with real spike responses of the same neurons, we show that space-clamping errors did not qualitatively affect the estimation of spike responses derived from synaptic currents in \",\n",
       " 'Dysregulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in many temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) models. Most dentate granule cells (DGCs) generated in response to an epileptic insult develop features that promote increased excitability, including ectopic location, persistent hilar basal dendrites (HBDs), and mossy fiber sprouting. However, some appear to integrate normally and even exhibit reduced excitability compared to other DGCs. To examine the relationship between DGC birthdate, morphology, and network integration in a model of TLE, we retrovirally birthdated either early-born [EB; postnatal day (P)7] or adult-born (AB; P60) DGCs. Male rats underwent pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) or sham treatment at P56. Three to six months after SE or sham treatment, we used whole-cell patch-clamp and fluorescence microscopy to record spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory currents from birthdated DGCs. We found that both AB and EB populations of DGCs recorded from epileptic rats received increased excitatory input compared with age-matched controls. Interestingly, when AB populations were separated into normally integrated (normotopic) and aberrant (ectopic or HBD-containing) subpopulations, only the aberrant populations exhibited a relative increase in excitatory input (amplitude, frequency, and charge transfer). The ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory input was most dramatically upregulated for ectopically localized DGCs. These data provide definitive physiological evidence that aberrant integration of post-SE, AB DGCs contributes to increased synaptic drive and support the idea that ectopic DGCs serve as putative hub cells to promote seizures.',\n",
       " 'Reliable timing of cortical spikes in response to visual events is crucial in representing visual inputs to the brain. Spikes in the primary visual cortex (V1) need to occur at the same time within a repeated visual stimulus. Two classical mechanisms are employed by the cortex to enhance reliable timing. First, cortical neurons respond reliably to a restricted set of stimuli through their preference for certain patterns of membrane potential due to their intrinsic properties. Second, intracortical networking of excitatory and inhibitory neurons induces lateral inhibition that, through the timing and strength of IPSCs and EPSCs, produces sparse and reliably timed cortical neuron spike trains to be transmitted downstream. Here, we describe a third mechanism that, through preferential thalamocortical synaptic connectivity, enhances the trial-to-trial timing precision of cortical spikes in the presence of spike train variability within each trial that is introduced between LGN neurons in the retino-thalamic pathway. Applying experimentally recorded LGN spike trains from the anesthetized cat to a detailed model of a spiny stellate V1 neuron, we found that output spike timing precision improved with increasing numbers of convergent LGN inputs. The improvement was consistent with the predicted proportionality of [Formula: see text] for ',\n",

HIV-associated CNS dysfunction includes impairments in memory, attention, memory processing, and retrieval.

Furthermore, we found that a lower protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, a phosphatase responsible for Syn I (S9) dephosphorylation, is primarily associated with the higher S9 phosphorylation in the frontal cortex of SIV-infected macaques. Comparison of brain sections confirmed higher Syn I (S9) in the frontal cortex and greater coexpression of Syn I and PP2A A subunit, which was observed as perinuclear aggregates in the somata of the frontal cortex of SIV-infected macaques.

       " 'Sensorimotor deficits are prevalent in many neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, including one of its common genetic etiologies, a 600 kb reciprocal deletion/duplication at 16p11.2. We have previously shown that copy number variations of 16p11.2 impact regional brain volume, white matter integrity, and early sensory responses in auditory cortex. Here, we test the hypothesis that abnormal cortical neurophysiology is present when genes in the 16p11.2 region are haploinsufficient, and in humans that this in turn may account for behavioral deficits specific to deletion carriers. We examine sensorimotor cortical network activity in males and females with 16p11.2 deletions compared with both typically developing individuals, and those with duplications of 16p11.2, using magnetoencephalographic imaging during preparation of overt speech or hand movements in tasks designed to be easy for all participants. In deletion carriers, modulation of beta oscillations (12-30 Hz) were increased during both movement types over effector-specific regions of motor cortices compared with typically developing individuals or duplication carriers, with no task-related performance differences between cohorts, even when corrected for their own cognitive and sensorimotor deficits. Reduced left hemispheric language specialization was observed in deletion carriers but not in duplication carriers. Neural activity over sensorimotor cortices in deletion carriers was linearly related to clinical measures of speech and motor impairment. These findings link insufficient copy number repeats at 16p11.2 to excessive neural activity (e.g., increased beta oscillations) in motor cortical networks for speech and hand motor control. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural basis of autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",
       " 'Sleep has been hypothesized to rebalance overall synaptic strength after ongoing learning during waking leads to net synaptic potentiation. If so, because synaptic strength and size are correlated, synapses on average should be larger after wake and smaller after sleep. This prediction was recently confirmed in mouse cerebral cortex using serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM). However, whether these findings extend to other brain regions is unknown. Moreover, sleep deprivation by gentle handling was reported to produce hippocampal spine loss, raising the question of whether synapse size and number are differentially affected by sleep and waking. Here we applied SBEM to measure axon-spine interface (ASI), the contact area between pre-synapse and post-synapse, and synapse density in CA1 stratum radiatum. Adolescent YFP-H mice were studied after 6-8 h of sleep (S = 6), spontaneous wake at night (W = 4) or wake enforced during the day by novelty exposure (EW = 4; males/females balanced). In each animal ≥425 ASIs were measured and synaptic vesicles were counted in ~100 synapses/mouse. Reconstructed dendrites included many small, nonperforated synapses and fewer large, perforated synapses. Relative to S, ASI sizes in perforated synapses shifted toward higher values after W and more so after EW. ASI sizes in nonperforated synapses grew after EW relative to S and W, and so did their density. ASI size correlated with presynaptic vesicle number but the proportion of readily available vesicles decreased after EW, suggesting presynaptic fatigue. Thus, CA1 synapses undergo changes consistent with sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization and their number increases after extended wake.',\n",

       " \"Artificial agents are becoming prevalent across human life domains. However, the neural mechanisms underlying human responses to these new, artificial social partners remain unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis predicts that humans prefer anthropomorphic agents but reject them if they become too humanlike-the so-called UV reaction. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activity when subjects evaluated artificial agents and made decisions about them. Across two experimental tasks, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) encoded an explicit representation of subjects' UV reactions. Specifically, VMPFC signaled the subjective likability of artificial agents as a nonlinear function of humanlikeness, with selective low likability for highly humanlike agents. In exploratory across-subject analyses, these effects explained individual differences in psychophysical evaluations and preference choices. Functionally connected areas encoded critical inputs for these signals: the temporoparietal junction encoded a linear humanlikeness continuum, whereas nonlinear representations of humanlikeness in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and fusiform gyrus emphasized a human-nonhuman distinction. Following principles of multisensory integration, multiplicative combination of these signals reconstructed VMPFC's valuation function. During decision making, separate signals in VMPFC and DMPFC encoded subjects' decision variable for choices involving humans or artificial agents, respectively. A distinct amygdala signal predicted rejection of artificial agents. Our data suggest that human reactions toward artificial agents are governed by a neural mechanism that generates a selective, nonlinear valuation in response to a specific feature combination (humanlikeness in nonhuman agents). Thus, a basic principle known from sensory coding-neural feature selectivity from linear-nonlinear transformation-may also underlie human responses to artificial social partners.\",\n",

       " 'There is widespread agreement that episodic memory is organized into a timeline of past experiences. Recent work suggests that the hippocampus may parse the flow of experience into discrete episodes separated by event boundaries. A complementary body of work suggests that context changes gradually as experience unfolds. We recorded from hippocampal neurons as male Long-Evans rats performed 6 blocks of an object discrimination task in sets of 15 trials. Each block was separated by removal from the testing chamber for a delay to enable segmentation. The reward contingency reversed from one block to the next to incentivize segmentation. We expected animals to hold two distinct, recurring representations of context to match the two distinct rule contingencies. Instead, we found that overtrained rats began each block neither above nor below chance but by guessing randomly. While many units had clear firing fields selective to the conjunction of objects in places, a significant population also reflected a continuously drifting code both within block and across blocks. Despite clear boundaries between blocks, we saw no neural evidence for event segmentation in this experiment. Rather, the hippocampal ensemble drifted continuously across time. This continuous drift in the neural representation was consistent with the lack of segmentation observed in behavior.',\n",
       " 'Navigating a changing environment requires associating stimuli and actions with their likely outcomes and modifying these associations when they change. These processes involve the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Although some molecular mediators have been identified, developmental factors are virtually unknown. We hypothesized that the cell adhesion factor β1-integrin is essential to OFC function, anticipating developmental windows during which β1-integrins might be more influential than others. We discovered that OFC-selective β1-integrin silencing before adolescence, but not later, impaired the ability of mice to extinguish conditioned fear and select actions based on their likely outcomes. Early-life knock-down also reduced the densities of dendritic spines, the primary sites of excitatory plasticity in the brain, and weakened sensitivity to cortical inputs. Notwithstanding these defects in male mice, females were resilient to OFC (but not hippocampal) β1-integrin loss. Existing literature suggests that resilience may be explained by estradiol-mediated transactivation of β1-integrins and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (trkB). Accordingly, we discovered that a trkB agonist administered during adolescence corrected reward-related decision making in β1-integrin-deficient males. In sum, developmental β1-integrins are indispensable for OFC function later in life.',\n",
       " \"Neuronal circuits regulating hunger and satiety synthesize information encoding the energy state of the animal and translate those signals into motivated behaviors to meet homeostatic needs. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are activated by energy surfeits and inhibited by energy deficits. When activated, these cells inhibit food intake and facilitate weight loss. Conversely, decreased activity in POMC cells is associated with increased food intake and obesity. Circulating nutrients and hormones modulate the activity of POMC neurons over protracted periods of time. However, recent work indicates that calcium activity in POMC cells changes in response to food cues on times scales consistent with the rapid actions of amino acid transmitters. Indeed, the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) onto POMC neurons increases during caloric deficits. However, the afferent brain regions responsible for this inhibitory modulation are currently unknown. Here, through the use of brain region-specific deletion of GABA release in both male and female mice we show that neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) are responsible for the majority of sIPSCs in POMC neurons as well as the fasting-induced increase in sIPSC frequency. Further, the readily releasable pool of GABA vesicles and the release probability of GABA is increased at DMH-to-POMC synapses following an overnight fast. Collectively these data provide evidence that DMH-to-POMC GABA circuitry conveys inhibitory neuromodulation onto POMC cells that is sensitive to the animal's energy state.\",\n",
       " 'Retrieval of learning-related neural activity patterns is thought to drive memory stabilization. However, finding reliable, noninvasive, content-specific indicators of memory retrieval remains a central challenge. Here, we attempted to decode the content of retrieved memories in the EEG during sleep. During encoding, male and female human subjects learned to associate spatial locations of visual objects with left- or right-hand movements, and each object was accompanied by an inherently related sound. During subsequent slow-wave sleep within an afternoon nap, we presented half of the sound cues that were associated (during wake) with left- and right-hand movements before bringing subjects back for a final postnap test. We trained a classifier on sleep EEG data (focusing on lateralized EEG features that discriminated left- vs right-sided trials during wake) to predict learning content when we cued the memories during sleep. Discrimination performance was significantly above chance and predicted subsequent memory, supporting the idea that retrieval leads to memory stabilization. Moreover, these lateralized signals increased with postcue sleep spindle power, demonstrating that retrieval has a strong relationship with spindles. These results show that lateralized activity related to individual memories can be decoded from sleep EEG, providing an effective indicator of offline retrieval.',\n",
       " \"Our understanding of the neural basis of perceptual decision making has been built in part on relating co-fluctuations of single neuron responses to perceptual decisions on a trial-by-trial basis. The strength of this relationship is often compared across neurons or brain areas, recorded in different sessions, animals, or variants of a task. We sought to extend our understanding of perceptual decision making in three ways. First, we measured neuronal activity simultaneously in early [primary visual cortex (V1)] and midlevel (V4) visual cortex while macaque monkeys performed a fine orientation discrimination perceptual task. This allowed a direct comparison of choice signals in these two areas, including their dynamics. Second, we asked how our ability to predict animals' decisions would be improved by considering small simultaneously-recorded neuronal populations rather than individual units. Finally, we asked whether predictions would be improved by taking into account the animals' choice and reward histories, which can strongly influence decision making. We found that responses of individual V4 neurons were weakly predictive of decisions, but only in a brief epoch between stimulus offset and the indication of choice. In V1, few neurons showed significant decision-related activity. Analysis of neuronal population responses revealed robust choice-related information in V4 and substantially weaker signals in V1. Including choice- and reward-history information improved performance further, particularly when the recorded populations contained little decision-related information. Our work shows the power of using neuronal populations and decision history when relating neuronal responses to the perceptual decisions they are thought to underlie.\",\n",

Across four cohorts of male rats, we used discrete lesions of the mammillothalamic tract to model aspects of diencephalic amnesia and assessed the impact of these lesions on multiple measures of activity and plasticity within the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. Lesions of the mammillothalamic tract had widespread indirect effects on hippocampocortical oscillatory activity within both theta and gamma bands. Both within-region oscillatory activity and cross-regional synchrony were altered. The network changes were state-dependent, displaying different profiles during locomotion and paradoxical sleep. Consistent with the associations between oscillatory activity and plasticity, complementary analyses using several convergent approaches revealed microstructural changes, which appeared to reflect a suppression of learning-induced plasticity in lesioned animals. Together, these combined findings suggest a mechanism by which damage to the medial diencephalon can impact upon learning and memory processes, highlighting an important role for the mammillary bodies in the coordination of hippocampocortical activity.',\n",

       " \"Tau is a microtubule (MT)-associated protein that is localized to the axon. In Alzheimer's disease, the distribution of tau undergoes a remarkable alteration, leading to the formation of tau inclusions in the somatodendritic compartment. To investigate how this mislocalization occurs, we recently developed immunohistochemical tools that can separately detect endogenous mouse and exogenous human tau with high sensitivity, which allows us to visualize not only the pathological but also the pre-aggregated tau in mouse brain tissues of both sexes. Using these antibodies, we found that in tau-transgenic mouse brains, exogenous human tau was abundant in dendrites and somata even in the presymptomatic period, whereas the axonal localization of endogenous mouse tau was unaffected. In stark contrast, exogenous tau was properly localized to the axon in human tau knock-in mice. We tracked this difference to the temporal expression patterns of tau. Endogenous mouse tau and exogenous human tau in human tau knock-in mice exhibited high expression levels during the neonatal period and strong suppression into the adulthood. However, human tau in transgenic mice was expressed continuously and at high levels in adult animals. These results indicated the uncontrolled expression of exogenous tau beyond the developmental period as a cause of mislocalization in the transgenic mice. Superresolution microscopic and biochemical analyses also indicated that the interaction between MTs and exogenous tau was impaired only in the tau-transgenic mice, but not in knock-in mice. Thus, the ectopic expression of tau may be critical for its somatodendritic mislocalization, a key step of the tauopathy.\",\n",
       " 'In the present study, we investigated motor cortex (M1) and a small portion of premotor and parietal cortex using intracortical microstimulation in anesthetized capuchin monkeys. Capuchins are the only New World monkeys that have evolved an opposable thumb and use tools in the wild. Like most Old World monkeys and humans, capuchin monkeys have highly dexterous hands. We surveyed a large extent of M1 and found that ~22% of all evoked movements in M1 involved the digits, and the majority of these consisted of finger flexions and extensions. Different subtypes of movements could be identified, including opposable movements of digits 1 and 2 (D1 and D2). Interestingly, the pattern of such movements varied between animals. In one case, movements involved the adduction of the medial surface of D1 toward the lateral surface of D2, whereas in the other case, the tips of D1 and D2 came in contact. Unlike other primates examined, we also found extensive representations of the prehensile foot and tail. We propose that the manual behavioral repertoire of capuchin monkeys, which includes the use of tools in the wild, is well represented within the motor cortex in the form of muscle synergies between different body parts that compose these larger, complex behaviors.',\n",
       " \"APP, whose mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), modulates neurotransmission via interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with the synaptic release machinery. Here we identified an intravesicular domain of APP, called intraluminal SV-APP interacting domain (ISVAID), which interacts with glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, synaptic vesicle proteins. ISVAID contains the β- and α-secretase cleavage sites of APP: proteomic analysis of the interactome of ISVAID suggests that β- and α-secretase cleavage of APP cuts inside the interaction domain of ISVAID and destabilizes protein-protein interactions. We have tested the functional significance of the ISVAID and of β-/α-secretase-processing of APP using various ISVAID-derived peptides in competition experiments on both female and male mouse and rats hippocampal slices. A peptide encompassing the entire ISVAID facilitated glutamate, but not GABA, release acting as dominant negative inhibitor of the functions of this APP domain in acute hippocampal slices. In contrast, peptides representing the product of β-/α-secretase-processing of ISVAID did not alter excitatory neurotransmitter release. These findings suggest that cleavage of APP by either β- or α-secretase may inactivate the ISVAID, thereby enhancing glutamate release. Our present data support the notion that APP tunes glutamate release, likely through intravesicular and extravesicular interactions with synaptic vesicle proteins and the neurotransmitter release machinery, and that β-/α cleavage of APP facilitates the release of excitatory neurotransmitter.\",\n",

       " 'It is a daily challenge for our brains to establish new memories via learning while providing stable storage of remote memories. In the adult vertebrate brain, bimodal regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) may regulate the delicate balance of learning-dependent plasticity and stable memory formation. Here, we trained adult male mice in a cortex-dependent auditory discrimination task and measured the abundance of ECM proteins brevican (BCN) and tenascin-R over the course of acquisition learning, consolidation, and long-term recall in two learning-relevant brain regions; the auditory cortex and hippocampus. Although early training led to a general downregulation of total ECM proteins, successful retrieval correlated with a region-specific and transient upregulation of BCN levels in the auditory cortex. No other parameter such as arousal or stress could account for the transient and region-specific BCN upregulation. This performance-dependent biphasic regulation of the ECM may assist transient plasticity to facilitate initial learning and subsequently promote the long-term consolidation of memory.',\n",

Proposals from previous studies, including evaluating past actions or selecting future ones, have been difficult to distinguish in part because of an incomplete understanding of the task-relevant variables that are encoded by individual cingulate neurons. In this study, we recorded from individual neurons in parts of both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in 2 male rhesus monkeys performing a saccadic reward task. The task required them to use adaptive, feedback-driven strategies to infer the spatial location of a rewarded saccade target in the presence of different forms of uncertainty. We found that task-relevant, spatially selective feedback signals were encoded by the activity of individual neurons in both brain regions, with stronger selectivity for spatial choice and reward-target signals in PCC and stronger selectivity for feedback in ACC. Moreover, neurons in both regions were sensitive to sequential effects of feedback that partly reflected sequential behavioral patterns. However, neither brain region exhibited systematic modulations by the blockwise conditions that governed the reliability of the trial-by-trial feedback and drove adaptive behavioral patterns. There was also little evidence that single-neuron responses in either brain region directly predicted the extent to which feedback and contextual information were used to inform choices on the subsequent trial. Thus, certain cingulate neurons encode diverse, evaluative signals needed for adaptive, feedback-driven decision-making, but those signals may be integrated elsewhere in the brain to guide actions.',\n",

First, using a bistable visual perception test, we measured the perceptual stability of 22 high-functioning adults with ASD and 22 age-, IQ-, and sex-matched typically developing human individuals and confirmed overstable visual perception in autism. Next, using a spontaneous task-switching (TS) test, we showed that the individuals with ASD were more likely to repeat the same task voluntarily and spontaneously, and such rigid TS behavior was associated with the severity of their RRB symptoms. We then compared these perceptual and cognitive behaviors and found a significant correlation between them for individuals with ASD. Finally, we found that this behavioral link was supported by a smaller gray matter volume (GMV) of the posterior superior parietal lobule (pSPL) in individuals with ASD. Moreover, this smaller GMV in the pSPL was also associated with the RRB symptoms and replicated in two independent datasets. Our findings suggest that the pSPL could be one of the neuroanatomical mediators of cognitive and perceptual inflexibility in autism, which could help a unified biological understanding of the mechanisms underpinning diverse symptoms of this developmental disorder.',\n",
       " \"The glymphatic system is a brainwide CSF transport system that uses the perivascular space for fast inflow of CSF. Arterial pulsations are a major driver of glymphatic CSF inflow, and hypertension that causes vascular pathologies, such as arterial stiffening and perivascular alterations, may impede the inflow. We used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to assess the effect of hypertension on glymphatic transport kinetics in male young and adult spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We anesthetized the rats with dexmedetomidine/isoflurane and infused paramagnetic contrast (Gd-DOTA) into the cisterna magna during dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify glymphatic transport kinetics. Structural MRI analysis showed that cerebroventricular volumes are larger and brain volumes significantly smaller in SHR compared with WKY rats, regardless of age. We observed ventricular reflux of Gd-DOTA in SHR rats only, indicating abnormal CSF flow dynamics secondary to innate hydrocephalus. One-tissue compartment analysis revealed impeded glymphatic transport of Gd-DOTA in SHR compared with WKY rats in both age groups, implying that glymphatic transport, including solute clearance from brain parenchyma, is impaired during evolving hypertension in young SHR, an effect that worsens in states of chronic hypertension. The study demonstrates the suppression of glymphatic clearance in SHR rats and thus offers new insight into the coexistence of hypertension and concomitant vascular pathologies in Alzheimer's disease. The study further highlights the importance of considering the distribution of tracers in the CSF compartment in the analysis of the glymphatic system.\",\n",

       " 'During nervous system development, axons often undergo elaborate changes in branching patterns before circuits have achieved their mature patterns of innervation. In the auditory system, type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) project their peripheral axons into the cochlear epithelium and then undergo a process of branch refinement before forming synapses with sensory hair cells. Here, we report that Semaphorin-5B (Sema5B) acts as an important mediator of this process. During cochlear development in mouse, immature hair cells express Sema5B, whereas the SGNs express both PlexinA1 and PlexinA3, which are known Sema5B receptors. In these studies, genetic sparse labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques were leveraged to determine the morphologies of individual type I SGNs after manipulations of Sema5B signaling.

We previously found that the ACC and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) regulate generalized fear. Here, we investigate the functional projections from the ACC and vHPC to the amygdala and their role in governing generalized fear in a preclinical rodent model. A chemogenetic approach (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs) was used to inhibit glutamatergic projections from the ACC or vHPC that terminate within the BLA at recent (1 d) or remote (28 d) time points after contextually fear conditioning male mice. Inactivating ACC or vHPC projections to the BLA significantly reduced generalized fear to a novel, nonthreatening context but had no effect on fear to the training context. Further, our data indicate that the ACC-BLA circuit supports generalization in a time-independent manner. We also identified, for the first time, a strictly time-dependent role of the vHPC-BLA circuit in supporting remote generalized contextual fear. Dysfunctional signaling to the amygdala from the ACC or the HPC could underlie overgeneralized fear responses that are associated with anxiety disorders. Our findings demonstrate that the ACC and vHPC regulate fear expressed in novel, nonthreatening environments via projections to the BLA but do so as a result of training intensity or time, respectively.',\n",

The present study thus investigated the effects of AMC training on VSWM and its neural correlates. A total of 144 human subjects (67 boys) were assigned to AMC or control groups at their entry to primary school. The AMC group received 2 h AMC training per week for 5 school years, whereas the control group spent the time in activities, such as conventional calculation and reading. Raven's Intelligence Test was administered both before and after training. Two arithmetic tests and a VSWM task were conducted after training. Among these participants, fMRI data were collected from 64 children for the VSWM task. Behavioral results indicated that the AMC group outperformed controls on both arithmetic and VSWM tasks, but not on Raven's Intelligence Test. While the two groups activated similar regions during the VSWM task, the AMC group showed greater activation than the controls in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Interestingly, the activation of right middle frontal gyrus mediated the relation between the arithmetic ability and the VSWM performance in the AMC group, suggesting that the frontal region may be the neural substrate underlying the transfer effect from AMC training to VSWM. Although the transfer effects seem quite limited considering the length and intensity of the training, these findings suggest that long-term AMC training not only improves arithmetic ability but also has a potential positive effect on VSWM.\",\n",

However, we know that the human brain is prone to biases at many perceptual and cognitive levels, often shaped by learning history and evolutionary constraints. Here, we explore one such perceptual phenomenon, perceiving animacy, and use the performance of neural networks as a benchmark. We performed an fMRI study that dissociated object appearance (what an object looks like) from object category (animate or inanimate) by constructing a stimulus set that includes animate objects (e.g., a cow), typical inanimate objects (e.g., a mug), and, crucially, inanimate objects that look like the animate objects (e.g., a cow mug). Behavioral judgments and deep neural networks categorized images mainly by animacy, setting all objects (lookalike and inanimate) apart from the animate ones. In contrast, activity patterns in ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VTC) were better explained by object appearance: animals and lookalikes were similarly represented and separated from the inanimate objects. Furthermore, the appearance of an object interfered with proper object identification, such as failing to signal that a cow mug is a mug. The preference in VTC to represent a lookalike as animate was even present when participants performed a task requiring them to report the lookalikes as inanimate. In conclusion, VTC representations, in contrast to neural networks, fail to represent objects when visual appearance is dissociated from animacy, probably due to a preferred processing of visual features typical of animate objects.',\n",
       " 'The way the human brain represents speech in memory is still unknown. An obvious characteristic of speech is its evolvement over time. During speech processing, neural oscillations are modulated by the temporal properties of the acoustic speech signal, but also acquired knowledge on the temporal structure of language influences speech perception-related brain activity. This suggests that speech could be represented in the temporal domain, a form of representation that the brain also uses to encode autobiographic memories. Empirical evidence for such a memory code is lacking. We investigated the nature of speech memory representations using direct cortical recordings in the left perisylvian cortex during delayed sentence reproduction in female and male patients undergoing awake tumor surgery. Our results reveal that the brain endogenously represents speech in the temporal domain. Temporal pattern similarity analyses revealed that the phase of frontotemporal low-frequency oscillations, primarily in the beta range, represents sentence identity in working memory. The positive relationship between beta power during working memory and task performance suggests that working memory representations benefit from increased phase separation.',\n",

Individuals with heightened sensitivity to punishment (SP) are especially susceptible to problem drinking via this maladaptive coping mechanism. As imaging studies have largely focused on sensation-seeking traits and approach behavior, the neural substrates underlying behavioral avoidance as well as their relationship with punishment sensitivity and alcohol use remain unclear. Here, we examined in humans the cerebral correlates of response inhibition to avoid a penalty in relation to both problem drinking and SP, as evaluated by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, respectively. Seventy nondependent female and male drinkers performed a reward go/no-go task with approximately two-thirds go and one-third no-go trials. Correct go and no-go responses were rewarded, and incorrect responses were punished. The results showed that SP and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores were both positively correlated with brain activations during response inhibition, and these activations overlapped in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Thus, the PCC may represent a shared neural substrate for avoidance, punishment sensitivity, and problem drinking. Mediation analyses further suggested that PCC response to avoidance completely and bidirectionally mediated the relationship between SP and hazardous alcohol use. These findings substantiated the role of the PCC in behavioral avoidance and its link to problem drinking in punishment-sensitive nondependent drinkers.',\n",
       " 'A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how sensory stimuli give rise to perception, especially when the process is supported by neural activity from an extended network of brain areas. Perception is inherently subjective, so interrogating its neural signatures requires, ideally, a combination of three factors: (1) behavioral tasks that separate stimulus-driven activity from perception per se; (2) human subjects who self-report their percepts while performing those tasks; and (3) concurrent neural recordings acquired at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we analyzed human electrocorticographic recordings obtained during an auditory task which supported mutually exclusive perceptual interpretations. Eight neurosurgical patients (5 male; 3 female) listened to sequences of repeated triplets where tones were separated in frequency by several semitones. Subjects reported spontaneous alternations between two auditory perceptual states, 1-stream and 2-stream, by pressing a button. We compared averaged auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) associated with 1-stream and 2-stream percepts and identified significant differences between them in primary and nonprimary auditory cortex, surrounding auditory-related temporoparietal cortex, and frontal areas. We developed classifiers to identify spatial maps of percept-related differences in the AEP, corroborating findings from statistical analysis. We used one-dimensional embedding spaces to perform the group-level analysis. Our data illustrate exemplar high temporal resolution AEP waveforms in auditory core region; explain inconsistencies in perceptual effects within auditory cortex, reported across noninvasive studies of streaming of triplets; show percept-related changes in frontoparietal areas previously highlighted by studies that focused on perceptual transitions; and demonstrate that auditory cortex encodes maintenance of percepts and switches between them.',\n",
       " 'ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) is a PI3K-like kinase best known for its role in the DNA damage response (DDR), especially after double-strand breaks. Mutations in the ATM gene result in a condition known as ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) that is characterized by cancer predisposition, radiosensitivity, neurodegeneration, sterility, and acquired immune deficiency. We show here that the innate immune system is not spared in A-T. ATM-deficient microglia adopt an active phenotype that includes the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines that are toxic to cultured neurons and likely contribute to A-T neurodegeneration. Causatively, ATM dysfunction results in the accumulation of DNA in the cytoplasm of microglia as well as a variety of other cell types. In microglia, cytoplasmic DNA primes an antiviral response via the DNA sensor, STING (stimulator of interferon genes). The importance of this response pathway is supported by our finding that inhibition of STING blocks the overproduction of neurotoxic cytokines. Cytosolic DNA also activates the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) containing inflammasome and induces proteolytic processing of cytokine precursors such as pro-IL-1β. Our study furthers our understanding of neurodegeneration in A-T and highlights the role of cytosolic DNA in the innate immune response.',\n",
       " 'Visual information reaches the cerebral cortex through parallel ON and OFF pathways that signal the presence of light and dark stimuli in visual scenes. We have previously demonstrated that optical blur reduces visual salience more for light than dark stimuli because it removes the high spatial frequencies from the stimulus, and low spatial frequencies drive weaker ON than OFF cortical responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that sustained optical blur during brain development should weaken ON cortical pathways more than OFF, increasing the dominance of darks in visual perception. Here we provide support for this hypothesis in humans with anisometropic amblyopia who suffered sustained optical blur early after birth in one of the eyes. In addition, we show that the dark dominance in visual perception also increases in strabismic amblyopes that have their vision to high spatial frequencies reduced by mechanisms not associated with optical blur. Together, we show that amblyopia increases visual dark dominance by 3-10 times and that the increase in dark dominance is strongly correlated with amblyopia severity. These results can be replicated with a computational model that uses greater luminance/response saturation in ON than OFF pathways and, as a consequence, reduces more ON than OFF cortical responses to stimuli with low spatial frequencies. We conclude that amblyopia affects the ON cortical pathway more than the OFF, a finding that could have implications for future amblyopia treatments.',\n",
       " 'Targeted stimulation can be used to modulate the activity of brain networks. Previously we demonstrated that direct electrical stimulation produces predictable poststimulation changes in brain excitability. However, understanding the neural dynamics during stimulation and its relationship to poststimulation effects is limited but critical for treatment optimization. Here, we applied 10 Hz direct electrical stimulation across several cortical regions in 14 human subjects (6 males) implanted with intracranial electrodes for seizure monitoring. The stimulation train was characterized by a consistent increase in high gamma (70-170 Hz) power. Immediately post-train, low-frequency (1-8 Hz) power increased, resulting in an evoked response that was highly correlated with the neural response during stimulation. Using two measures of network connectivity, corticocortical evoked potentials (indexing effective connectivity), and theta coherence (indexing functional connectivity), we found a stronger response to stimulation in regions that were highly connected to the stimulation site. In these regions, repeated cycles of stimulation trains and rest progressively altered the stimulation response. Finally, after just 2 min (∼10%) of repetitive stimulation, we were able to predict poststimulation connectivity changes with high discriminability. Together, this work reveals a relationship between stimulation dynamics and poststimulation connectivity changes in humans. Thus, measuring neural activity during stimulation can inform future plasticity-inducing protocols.',\n",

Inhibitors of MEK1/2, the kinases upstream of ERK1/2, have been critical in defining the role of the Ras-ERK cascade in drug-dependent alterations in behavioral plasticity, but the Ras family of small GTPases has not been extensively examined in drug-related behaviors. We examined the role of Ras Guanine Nucleotide Releasing Factor 1 (RasGRF1) and 2 (RasGRF2), upstream regulators of the Ras-ERK signaling cascade, on cocaine self-administration (SA) in male mice. We first established a role for Ras-ERK signaling in cocaine SA, demonstrating that pERK1/2 is upregulated following SA in C57BL/6N mice in striatum. We then compared RasGRF1 and RasGRF2 KO mouse lines, demonstrating that cocaine SA in RasGRF2 KO mice was increased relative to WT controls, whereas RasGRF1 KO and WT mice did not differ. This effect in RasGRF2 mice is likely mediated by the Ras-ERK signaling pathway, as pERK1/2 upregulation following cocaine SA was absent in RasGRF2 KO mice. Interestingly, the lentiviral knockdown of RasGRF2 in the NAc had the opposite effect to that in RasGRF2 KO mice, reducing cocaine SA. We subsequently demonstrated that the MEK inhibitor PD325901 administered peripherally prior to cocaine SA increased cocaine intake, replicating the increase seen in RasGRF2 KO mice, whereas PD325901 administered into the NAc decreased cocaine intake, similar to the effect seen following lentiviral knockdown of RasGRF2. These data indicate a role for RasGRF2 in cocaine SA in mice that is ERK-dependent, and suggest a differential effect of global versus site-specific RasGRF2 inhibition.',\n",

Loss of CHL1 in null mutant mice in both genders resulted in increased spine density and a greater proportion of immature spines on apical dendrites in the prefrontal and visual cortex. Electron microscopy showed that excitatory spine synapses with postsynaptic densities were increased in the CHL1-null cortex, and electrophysiological recording in prefrontal slices from mutant mice revealed deficiencies in excitatory synaptic transmission. Mechanistically, Sema3B protein induced elimination of spines on apical dendrites of cortical neurons cultured from wild-type but not CHL1-null embryos. Sema3B was secreted by the cortical neuron cultures, and its levels increased when cells were treated with the GABA antagonist gabazine. ',\n",
       " 'In this paper, we draw from recent theoretical work on active perception, which suggests that the brain makes use of an internal (i.e., generative) model to make inferences about the causes of sensations. This view treats visual sensations as consequent on action (i.e., saccades) and implies that visual percepts must be actively constructed via a sequence of eye movements. Oculomotor control calls on a distributed set of brain sources that includes the dorsal and ventral frontoparietal (attention) networks. We argue that connections from the frontal eye fields to ventral parietal sources represent the mapping from \"where\", fixation location to information derived from \"what\" representations in the ventral visual stream. During scene construction, this mapping must be learned, putatively through changes in the effective connectivity of these synapses. Here, we test the hypothesis that the coupling between the dorsal frontal cortex and the right temporoparietal cortex is modulated during saccadic interrogation of a simple visual scene. Using dynamic causal modeling for magnetoencephalography with (male and female) human participants, we assess the evidence for changes in effective connectivity by comparing models that allow for this modulation with models that do not. We find strong evidence for modulation of connections between the two attention networks; namely, a disinhibition of the ventral network by its dorsal counterpart.',\n",

Dramatically, with the exception of two individuals, both of whom had relatively greater cortical alterations, all patients showed normal perceptual performance on tasks of intermediate- and high-level vision, including face and object recognition. Consistently, again with the exception of the same two individuals, both univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses revealed normal selectivity and representational structure of category-selective regions. Furthermore, the spatial organization of category-selective regions obeyed the typical medial-to-lateral topographic organization albeit unilaterally in the structurally preserved hemisphere rather than bilaterally.

Human studies have shown that through discriminative learning of similar objects, both item memory and contextual memories are enhanced. However, the underlying neural mechanisms for it are unclear. The hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (PRC) are two possible regions involved in discriminating similar stimuli and forming distinctive memory representations. In this study, 28 participants (15 males) were scanned using high-resolution fMRI when a picture (e.g., a dog) was paired with the same picture, with a similar picture of the same concept (e.g., another dog), or with a picture of a different concept (e.g., a cat). Then, after intervals of 20 min and 1 week, the participants were asked to perform an old/new recognition task, followed by a contextual judgment. The results showed that during encoding, there was stronger activation in the PRC for the \"similar\" than for the \"same\" and \"different\" conditions and it predicted subsequent item memory for the \"similar\" condition. The hippocampal activation decreased for the \"same\" versus the \"different\" condition and the DG/CA3 activation predicted subsequent contextual memory for the \"similar\" condition. These results suggested that the PRC and hippocampus are functionally dissociated in encoding simultaneously presented objects and predicting subsequent item and contextual memories after discriminative learning.',\n",

Here, we demonstrated that male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited peripheral metabolic impairments reminiscent of IR accompanied by elevated circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whereas both parameters were normalized by chronic treatment with metformin (Met). Given the role of BCAAs in the regulation of tryptophan influx into the brain, we then explored the activity of the serotonin (5-HT) system. Our results indicated that HFD-fed mice displayed impairment in the electrical activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons, attenuated hippocampal extracellular 5-HT concentrations and anxiety, one of the most visible and early symptoms of depression. On the contrary, Met stimulated 5-HT neurons excitability and 5-HT neurotransmission while hindering HFD-induced anxiety. Met also promoted antidepressant-like activities as observed with fluoxetine. In light of these data, we designed a modified HFD in which BCAA dietary supply was reduced by half. Deficiency in BCAAs failed to reverse HFD-induced metabolic impairments while producing antidepressant-like activity and enhancing the behavioral response to fluoxetine. Our results suggest that Met may act by decreasing circulating BCAAs levels to favor serotonergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and promote antidepressant-like effects in mice fed an HFD. These findings also lead us to envision that a diet poor in BCAAs, provided either alone or as add-on therapy to conventional antidepressant drugs, could help to relieve depressive symptoms in patients with metabolic comorbidities.',\n",

The tonotopic array of T-stellate cells enhances the encoding of spectral peaks relative to their auditory nerve fiber inputs. The alignment of local collaterals and T-stellate cell dendrites within the isofrequency lamina suggests that the cells make connections within the isofrequency lamina in which they reside. Recordings from pairs of T-stellate cells in mice of both sexes revealed that firing in the presynaptic cell evoked responses in the postsynaptic cell when presynaptic firing was paired with depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. After such experimental coactivation, presynaptic firing evoked EPSCs of uniform amplitude whose frequency depended on the duration of depolarization and diminished over minutes. Nitric oxide (NO) donors evoked EPSCs in T-stellate cells but not in the other types of principal cells. Blockers of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and of NMDA receptors blocked potentiation, indicating that NO mediates potentiation. nNOS and its receptor, guanylate cyclase (NO-GC), are expressed in somata of T-stellate cells. Excitatory interconnections were bidirectional and polysynaptic, indicating that T-stellate cells connect in networks. Positive feedback provided by temporarily potentiated interconnections between T-stellate cells could enhance the gain of auditory nerve excitation in proportion to the excitation, generating a form of short-term central gain control that could account for the ability of T-stellate cells to enhance the encoding of spectral peaks.',\n",
       " 'Recent theoretical advances have motivated the hypothesis that the periaqueductal gray (PAG) participates in behaviors that involve changes in the autonomic control of visceromotor activity, including during cognitively demanding tasks. We used ultra-high-field (7 tesla) fMRI to measure human brain activity at 1.1 mm resolution while participants completed a working memory task. Consistent with prior work, participants were less accurate and responded more slowly with increasing memory load-signs of increasing task difficulty. Whole-brain fMRI analysis revealed increased activity in multiple cortical areas with increasing working memory load, including frontal and parietal cortex, dorsal cingulate, supplementary motor area, and anterior insula. Several dopamine-rich midbrain nuclei, such as the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, also exhibited load-dependent increases in activation. To investigate PAG involvement during cognitive engagement, we developed an automated method for segmenting and spatially normalizing the PAG. Analyses using cross-validated linear support vector machines showed that the PAG discriminated high versus low working memory load conditions with 95% accuracy in individual subjects based on activity increases in lateral and ventrolateral PAG. Effect sizes in the PAG were comparable in magnitude to those in many of the cortical areas. These findings suggest that cognitive control is not only associated with cortical activity in the frontal and parietal lobes, but also with increased activity in the subcortical PAG and other midbrain regions involved in the regulation of autonomic nervous system function.',\n",

Surprisingly, male Vglut1-ChR2 mice did not show significant differences in light-evoked behaviors or real-time aversion after nerve injury despite marked hypersensitivity to punctate mechanical stimuli.

Here we used EEG to demonstrate that trial-by-trial neural variability was reduced by visual cues that modulated alertness and spatial attention. Reductions in neural variability were specific to the visual system and larger in the contralateral hemisphere of the attended visual field. Subjects with higher initial levels of neural variability and larger decreases in variability exhibited greater behavioral benefits from attentional cues. These findings demonstrate that both alertness and spatial attention modulate neural variability and highlight the importance of reducing/quenching neural variability for attaining the behavioral benefits of attention.',\n",

       " 'Sensitivity to the sequential structure of communication sounds is fundamental not only for language comprehension in humans but also for song recognition in songbirds. By quantifying single-unit responses, we first assessed whether the sequential order of song elements, called syllables, in conspecific songs is encoded in a secondary auditory cortex-like region of the zebra finch brain. Based on a habituation/dishabituation paradigm, we show that, after multiple repetitions of the same conspecific song, rearranging syllable order reinstated strong responses. A large proportion of neurons showed sensitivity to song context in which syllables occurred providing support for the nonlinear processing of syllable sequences. Sensitivity to the temporal order of items within a sequence should enable learning its underlying structure, an ability considered a core mechanism of the human language faculty. We show that repetitions of songs that were ordered according to a specific grammatical structure (i.e., ABAB or AABB structures; A and B denoting song syllables) led to different responses in both anesthetized and awake birds. Once responses were decreased due to song repetitions, the transition from one structure to the other could affect the firing rates and/or the spike patterns. Our results suggest that detection was based on local differences rather than encoding of the global song structure as a whole. Our study demonstrates that a high-level auditory region provides neuronal mechanisms to help discriminate stimuli that differ in their sequential structure.',\n",
       " 'Glutamate is one of the most important neurotransmitters in the process of signal transduction in the CNS. Excessive amounts of this neurotransmitter lead to glutamate excitotoxicity, which is accountable for neuronal death in acute neurological disorders, including stroke and trauma, and in neurodegenerative diseases. Inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) plays multiple roles in the mammalian brain, including function as a calcium-dependent gliotransmitter mediating communication between astrocytes, while its role in the regulation of neuronal activity is unknown. Here we studied the effect of PolyP on glutamate-induced calcium signal in primary rat neurons in both physiological and pathological conditions. We found that preincubation of primary neurons with PolyP reduced glutamate-induced and AMPA-induced but not the NMDA-induced calcium signal. However, in rat hippocampal acute slices, PolyP reduced ion flux through NMDA and AMPA receptors in native neurons. The effect of PolyP on glutamate and specifically on the AMPA receptors was dependent on the presence of P2Y1 but not of P2X receptor inhibitors and also could be mimicked by P2Y1 agonist 2MeSADP. Preincubation of cortical neurons with PolyP significantly reduced the initial calcium peak as well as the number of neurons with delayed calcium deregulation in response to high concentrations of glutamate and resulted in protection of neurons against glutamate-induced cell death. As a result, activation of P2Y1 receptors by PolyP reduced calcium signal acting through AMPA receptors, thus protecting neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity by reduction of the calcium overload and restoration of mitochondrial function.',\n",

While endogenous remyelination, driven by resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), might partially compensate myelin loss in the early phases of demyelinating disorders, this spontaneous reparative potential fails at later stages. To investigate the cellular mechanisms sustaining endogenous remyelination in demyelinating disorders, we focused our attention on endogenous neural precursor cells (eNPCs) located within the subventricular zone (SVZ) since this latter area is considered one of the primary sources of new OPCs in the adult forebrain. First, we fate mapped SVZ-eNPCs in cuprizone-induced demyelination and found that SVZ endogenous neural stem/precursor cells are recruited during the remyelination phase to the corpus callosum (CC) and are capable of forming new oligodendrocytes. When we ablated SVZ-derived eNPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination in female mice, the animals displayed reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes within the lesioned CC. Although this reduction in oligodendrocytes did not impact the ensuing remyelination, eNPC-ablated mice experienced increased axonal loss. Our results indicate that, in toxic models of demyelination, SVZ-derived eNPCs contribute to support axonal survival.',\n",

This, along with questions about long-term retention of learning, limits practical and clinical applications of many such paradigms. Here, we show for the first time in female and male human participants that just 10 d of visual training coupled with transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over visual areas causes dramatic improvements in visual motion perception. Relative to control conditions and anodal stimulation, tRNS-enhanced learning was at least twice as fast, and, crucially, it persisted for 6 months after the end of training and stimulation. Notably, tRNS also boosted learning in patients with chronic cortical blindness, leading to recovery of motion processing in the blind field after just 10 d of training, a period too short to elicit enhancements with training alone. In sum, our results reveal a remarkable enhancement of the capacity for long-lasting plastic and restorative changes when a neuromodulatory intervention is coupled with visual training.',\n",
       " 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two noninvasive methods commonly used to study neural mechanisms supporting visual attention in humans. Studies using these tools, which have complementary spatial and temporal resolutions, implicitly assume they index similar underlying neural modulations related to external stimulus and internal attentional manipulations. Accordingly, they are often used interchangeably for constraining understanding about the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on neural modulations. To test this core assumption, we simultaneously manipulated bottom-up sensory inputs by varying stimulus contrast and top-down cognitive modulations by changing the focus of spatial attention. Each of the male and female subjects participated in both fMRI and EEG sessions performing the same experimental paradigm. We found categorically different patterns of attentional modulation on fMRI activity in early visual cortex and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG (e.g., the P1 component and steady-state visually-evoked potentials): fMRI activation scaled additively with attention, whereas evoked EEG components scaled multiplicatively with attention. However, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and oscillatory EEG signals in the alpha band revealed additive attentional modulation patterns like those observed with fMRI. These results challenge prior assumptions that fMRI and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured with EEG can be interchangeably used to index the same neural mechanisms of attentional modulations at different spatiotemporal scales. Instead, fMRI measures of attentional modulations are more closely linked with later EEG components and alpha-band oscillations. Considered together, hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals can jointly constrain understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting cognition.',\n",
       " 'Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of neuronal depolarization thought to underlie migraine aura. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator involved in migraine pathophysiology. Evidence for functional connectivity between CSD and CGRP has triggered scientific interest in the possibility that CGRP antagonism may disrupt vascular responses to CSD and the ensuing plasma protein extravasation (PPE). Using imaging tools that allow us to generate continuous, live, high-resolution views of spatial and temporal changes that affect arteries and veins in the dura and pia, we determined the extent to which CGRP contributes to the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD in female rats, and how these events are affected by the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody (anti-CGRP-mAb) fremanezumab. We found that the CSD-induced brief dilatation and prolonged constriction of pial arteries, prolonged dilatation of dural arteries and PPE are all unaffected by fremanezumab, whereas the brief constriction and prolonged dilatation of pial veins are affected. In comparison, although CGRP infusion gave rise to the expected dilatation of dural arteries, which was effectively blocked by fremanezumab, it did not induce dilatation in pial arteries, pial veins, or dural veins. It also failed to induce PPE. Regardless of whether the nociceptors become active before or after the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD, the inability of fremanezumab to prevent them suggests that these events are not mediated by CGRP, a conclusion with important implications for our understanding of the mechanism of action of anti-CGRP-mAbs in migraine prevention.',\n",

Gestures consisted of videos of an actress performing object-use pantomimes (iconic representations of object-directed actions; e.g., playing guitar), emblems (conventional gestures, e.g., thumb up), and meaningless gestures. Word stimuli (verbs, nouns) consisted of video clips of the same actress pronouncing words. We found a stronger response to meaningful compared with meaningless gestures along the whole left and large portions of the right MTG. Importantly, we observed a gradient, with posterior regions responding more strongly to gestures (pantomimes and emblems) than words and anterior regions showing a stronger response to words than gestures. In an intermediate region in the left hemisphere, the response was significantly higher to words and emblems (i.e., items with a greater arbitrariness of the sign-to-meaning mapping) than to pantomimes. These results show that the large-scale organization of information in the MTG is driven by the input modality and may also reflect the arbitrariness of the relationship between sign and meaning.',\n",
       " 'The striatum comprises of multiple functional territories involved with multilevel control of behavior. Disinhibition of different functional territories leads to territory-specific hyperkinetic and hyperbehavioral symptoms. The ventromedial striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, is typically associated with limbic input but was historically linked to high-level motor control. In this study, performed in female Long-Evans rats, we show that the NAc core directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. On the macro-scale, following NAc disinhibition, the animals manifested prolonged hyperactivity, expressed as excessive normal behavior, whereas on the micro-scale multiple behavior transitions occurred, generating short movement segments. The underlying striatal network displayed population-based local field potential transient deflections (LFP spikes) whose rate determined the magnitude of the hyperactivity and whose timing corresponded to unitary behavioral transition events. Individual striatal neurons preserved normal baseline activity and network interactions following the disinhibition, maintaining the normal encoding of behavioral primitives and forming a sparse link between the LFP spikes and single neuron activity. Disinhibition of this classically limbic territory leads to profound motor changes resembling hyperactivity and attention deficit. These behavioral and neuronal results highlight the direct interplay on multiple timescales between different striatal territories during normal and pathological conditions.',\n",

       " 'Neural circuit development involves the coordinated growth and guidance of axons. During this process, axons encounter many different cues, but how these cues are integrated and translated into growth is poorly understood. In this study, we report that receptor signaling does not follow a linear path but changes dependent on developmental stage and coreceptors involved. Using developing chicken embryos of both sexes, our data show that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor important for regulating calcium homeostasis, regulates neurite growth in two distinct ways. First, when signaling in isolation, CaSR promotes growth through the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway. At later developmental stages, CaSR enhances tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/BDNF-mediated neurite growth. This enhancement is facilitated through a switch in the signaling cascade downstream of CaSR (i.e., from the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway to activation of GSK3α Tyr279). TrkB and CaSR colocalize within late endosomes, cotraffic and coactivate GSK3, which serves as a shared signaling node for both receptors. Our study provides evidence that two unrelated receptors can integrate their individual signaling cascades toward a nonadditive effect and thus control neurite growth during development.',\n",

These cross-modal processes have been shown to be driven by occipital oscillatory activity within the alpha band. Whether this phenomenon is network specific or can be generalized to other sensory interactions remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to test whether cross-modal interactions between somatosensory-to-visual areas leading to the same (but tactile-induced) DFI share similar properties with the auditory DFI. We hypothesized that if the effects are mediated by the oscillatory properties of early visual areas per se, then the two versions of the illusion should be subtended by the same neurophysiological mechanism (i.e., the speed of the alpha frequency). Alternatively, if the oscillatory activity in visual areas predicting this phenomenon is dependent on the specific neural network involved, then it should reflect network-specific oscillatory properties. In line with the latter, results recorded in humans (both sexes) show a network-specific oscillatory profile linking the auditory DFI to occipital alpha oscillations, replicating previous findings, and tactile DFI to occipital beta oscillations, a rhythm typical of somatosensory processes. These frequency-specific effects are observed for visual (but not auditory or somatosensory) areas and account for auditory-visual connectivity in the alpha band and somatosensory-visual connectivity in the beta band. We conclude that task-dependent visual oscillations reflect network-specific oscillatory properties favoring optimal directional neural communication timing for sensory binding.',\n",
       " 'Humans excel at understanding speech even in adverse conditions such as background noise. Speech processing may be aided by cortical activity in the delta and theta frequency bands, which have been found to track the speech envelope. However, the rhythm of non-speech sounds is tracked by cortical activity as well. It therefore remains unclear which aspects of neural speech tracking represent the processing of acoustic features, related to the clarity of speech, and which aspects reflect higher-level linguistic processing related to speech comprehension. Here we disambiguate the roles of cortical tracking for speech clarity and comprehension through recording EEG responses to native and foreign language in different levels of background noise, for which clarity and comprehension vary independently. We then use a both a decoding and an encoding approach to relate clarity and comprehension to the neural responses. We find that cortical tracking in the theta frequency band is mainly correlated to clarity, whereas the delta band contributes most to speech comprehension. Moreover, we uncover an early neural component in the delta band that informs on comprehension and that may reflect a predictive mechanism for language processing. Our results disentangle the functional contributions of cortical speech tracking in the delta and theta bands to speech processing. They also show that both speech clarity and comprehension can be accurately decoded from relatively short segments of EEG recordings, which may have applications in future mind-controlled auditory prosthesis.',\n",

Cross-sectional studies have shown age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, less is known about the longitudinal changes in brain functional modular organization and their associations with aging-related cognitive decline. We examined age- and aging-related changes in functional architecture of the cerebral cortex using a dataset comprising a cross-sectional healthy young cohort of 57 individuals (mean ± SD age, 23.71 ± 3.61 years, 22 males) and a longitudinal healthy elderly cohort of 72 individuals (mean ± baseline age, 68.22 ± 5.80 years, 39 males) with 2-3 time points (18-24 months apart) of task-free fMRI data. We found both cross-sectional (elderly vs young) and longitudinal (in elderly) global decreases in network segregation (decreased local efficiency), integration (decreased global efficiency), and module distinctiveness (increased participation coefficient and decreased system segregation). At the modular level, whereas cross-sectional analyses revealed higher participation coefficient across all modules in the elderly compared with young participants, longitudinal analyses revealed focal longitudinal participation coefficient increases in three higher-order cognitive modules: control network, default mode network, and salience/ventral attention network. Cross-sectionally, elderly participants also showed worse attention performance with lower local efficiency and higher mean participation coefficient, and worse global cognitive performance with higher participation coefficient in the dorsal attention/control network.

Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we recently showed that the concentration of dorsal striatal choline (an acetylcholine precursor) changes during reversal learning (a measure of behavioral flexibility) in humans. The aim of the present study was to examine whether regional average striatal choline was associated with reversal learning. A total of 22 participants (mean age = 25.2 years, range = 18-32 years, 13 female) reached learning criterion in a probabilistic learning task with a reversal component. We measured choline at rest in both the dorsal and ventral striatum using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Task performance was described using a simple reinforcement learning model that dissociates the contributions of positive and negative prediction errors to learning. Average levels of choline in the dorsal striatum were associated with performance during reversal, but not during initial learning. Specifically, lower levels of choline in the dorsal striatum were associated with a lower number of perseverative trials. Moreover, choline levels explained interindividual variance in perseveration over and above that explained by learning from negative prediction errors. These findings suggest that the dorsal striatal cholinergic system plays an important role in behavioral flexibility, in line with evidence from the animal literature and our previous work in humans. Additionally, this work provides further support for the idea of measuring choline with magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a noninvasive way of studying human cholinergic neurochemistry.',\n",

Here, we report that ASIC1a in ACC is required for thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity associated with chronic pain. ACC-specific genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of ASIC1a reduced the probability of cortical LTP induction and attenuated inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in male mice. Using cell type-specific manipulations, we demonstrate that ASIC1a in excitatory neurons of ACC is a major player in cortical LTP and pain behavior. Mechanistically, we show that ASIC1a tuned pain-related cortical plasticity through protein kinase C λ-mediated increase of membrane trafficking of AMPAR subunit GluA1 in ACC. Importantly, postapplication of ASIC1a inhibitors in ACC reversed previously established nociceptive hypersensitivity in both chronic inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain models. These results suggest that ASIC1a critically contributes to a higher level of pain processing through synaptic potentiation in ACC, which may serve as a promising analgesic target for treatment of chronic pain.',\n",

Even fewer studies examine neural responses to these natural stimuli. Decades of research have investigated the rat vibrissal (whisker) system in the context of direct touch and tactile stimulation, but recent work has shown that rats also use their whiskers to help detect and localize airflow. The present study investigates the neural basis for this ability as dictated by the mechanical response of whiskers to airflow. Mechanical experiments show that a whisker's vibration magnitude depends on airspeed and the intrinsic shape of the whisker. Surprisingly, the direction of the whisker's vibration changes as a function of airflow speed: vibrations transition from parallel to perpendicular with respect to the airflow as airspeed increases. Recordings from primary sensory trigeminal ganglion neurons show that these neurons exhibit responses consistent with those that would be predicted from direct touch. Trigeminal neuron firing rate increases with airspeed, is modulated by the orientation of the whisker relative to the airflow, and is influenced by the whisker's resonant frequencies. We develop a simple model to describe how a population of neurons could leverage mechanical relationships to decode both airspeed and direction. These results open new avenues for studying vibrissotactile regions of the brain in the context of evolutionarily important airflow-sensing behaviors and olfactory search.

We calculated the AM representation in the DNN and quantitatively compared it with those reported in previous neurophysiological studies. We found that an auditory-system-like AM tuning emerges in the optimized DNN. Better-recognizing models showed greater similarity to the auditory system. We isolated the factors forming the AM representation in the different brain regions.

We report that pharmacological inhibition of microtubule polymerization in the NAc inhibited locomotor sensitization to cocaine and contextual reward learning. We then investigated the roles of microtubule end-binding protein 3 (EB3) and SRC kinase in the neuronal and behavioral responses to volitionally administered cocaine. In synaptoneurosomal fractions from the NAc of self-administering male rats, the phosphorylation of SRC at an activating site was induced after 1 d of withdrawal, while EB3 levels were increased only after 30 d of withdrawal. Blocking SRC phosphorylation during early withdrawal by virally overexpressing SRCIN1, a negative regulator of SRC activity known to interact with EB3, abolished the incubation of cocaine craving in both male and female rats. Conversely, mimicking the EB3 increase observed after prolonged withdrawal increased the motivation to consume cocaine in male rats. In mice, the overexpression of either EB3 or SRCIN1 increased dendritic spine density and altered the spine morphology of NAc medium spiny neurons. Finally, a cocaine challenge after prolonged withdrawal recapitulated most of the synaptic protein expression profiles observed at early withdrawal. These findings suggest that microtubule-associated signaling proteins such as EB3 cooperate with actin remodeling pathways, notably SRC kinase activity, to establish and maintain long-lasting cellular and behavioral alterations following cocaine self-administration.',\n",

Animals susceptible to CSD show activation of microglia, which have elevated levels of oxidative stress markers. We hypothesized that microglia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contribute to the CSD stress-induced changes in affective behavior. First, we selectively depleted microglia (99%) by administering the CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor) antagonist PLX5622 before and during the 14 d CSD procedure. Microglia-depleted mice in contrast to nondepleted mice were protected from the stress effects measured by light/dark and social interaction tests.

       " 'Although spatial and feature attention have differing effects on neuronal responses in visual cortex, it remains unclear why. Response normalization has been implicated in both types of attention (Carandini and Heeger, 2011), and single-unit studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of spatial attention effects on neuronal responses covaries with the magnitude of normalization effects. However, the relationship between feature attention and normalization remains largely unexplored. We recorded from individual neurons in the middle temporal area of rhesus monkeys using a task that allowed us to isolate the effects of feature attention, spatial attention, and normalization on the responses of each neuron. We found that the magnitudes of neuronal response modulations due to spatial attention and feature attention are correlated; however, whereas modulations due to spatial attention are correlated with normalization strength, those due to feature attention are not. Additionally, spatial attention modulations are stronger with multiple stimuli in the receptive field, whereas feature attention modulations are not. These findings are captured by a model in which spatial and feature attention share common top-down attention signals that nonetheless result in differing sensory neuron response modulations because of a spatially tuned sensory normalization mechanism. This model explains previously reported commonalities and differences between these two types of attention by clarifying the relationship between top-down attention signals and sensory normalization. We conclude that similar top-down signals to visual cortex can have distinct effects on neuronal responses due to distinct interactions with sensory mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'Efficient perception in natural environments depends on neural interactions between voluntary processes within cognitive control, such as attention, and those that are automatic and subconscious, such as brain adaptation to predictable input (also called repetition suppression). Although both attention and adaptation have been studied separately and there is considerable knowledge of the neurobiology involved in each of these processes, how attention interacts with adaptation remains equivocal. We examined how attention interacts with visual and auditory adaptation by measuring neuroimaging effects consistent with changes in either neural gain or selectivity. Male and female human participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) first while they discriminated repetition of morphed faces or voices and either directed their attention to stimulus identity or spatial location. Attention to face or voice identity, while ignoring stimulus location, solely increased the gain of respectively face- or voice-sensitive cortex. The results were strikingly different in an experiment when participants attended to voice identity versus stimulus loudness. In this case, attention to voice while ignoring sound loudness increased neural selectivity. The combined results show that how attention affects adaptation depends on the level of feature-based competition, reconciling prior conflicting observations. The findings are theoretically important and are discussed in relation to neurobiological interactions between attention and different types of predictive signals.',\n",

Schwann cells and nerves from PMP22 knock-out (KO) mice show deranged cholesterol distribution and aberrant lipid raft morphology, supporting an unrecognized role for PMP22 in cellular lipid metabolism. To examine the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities, we studied Schwann cells and nerves from male and female PMP22 KO mice. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings in cultured Schwann cells revealed increased membrane capacitance and decreased membrane resistance in the absence of PMP22, which was consistent with a reduction in membrane cholesterol. Nerves from PMP22-deficient mice contained abnormal lipid droplets, with both mRNA and protein levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) being highly upregulated. Despite the upregulation of ABCA1 and apoE, the absence of PMP22 resulted in reduced localization of the transporter to the cell membrane and diminished secretion of apoE. The absence of PMP22 also impaired ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity. In nerves from ABCA1 KO mice, the expression of PMP22 was significantly elevated and the subcellular processing of the overproduced protein was aberrant. In wild-type samples, double immunolabeling identified overlapping distribution of PMP22 and ABCA1 at the Schwann cell plasma membrane and the two proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from Schwann cell and nerve lysates. Together, these results reveal a novel role for PMP22 in regulating lipid metabolism and cholesterol trafficking through functional interaction with the cholesterol efflux regulatory protein ABCA1.',\n",
       " 'Pupil size under constant illumination reflects brain arousal state, and dilates in response to novel information, or surprisal. Whether this response can be observed regardless of conscious perception is still unknown. In the present study, male and female adult humans performed an implicit learning task across a series of three experiments. We measured pupil and brain-evoked potentials to stimuli that violated transition statistics but were not relevant to the task. We found that pupil size dilated following these surprising events, in the absence of awareness of transition statistics, and only when attention was allocated to the stimulus. These pupil responses correlated with central potentials, evoking an anterior cingulate origin. Arousal response to surprisal outside the scope of conscious perception points to the fundamental relationship between arousal and information processing and indicates that pupil size can be used to track the progression of implicit learning.',\n",

       " 'Reading involves the rapid extraction of sound and meaning from print through a cooperative division of labor between phonological and lexical-semantic processes. Whereas lesion studies of patients with stereotyped acquired reading deficits contributed to the notion of a dissociation between phonological and lexical-semantic reading, the neuroanatomical basis for effects of lexicality (word vs pseudoword), orthographic regularity (regular vs irregular spelling-sound correspondences), and concreteness (concrete vs abstract meaning) on reading is underspecified, particularly outside the context of strong behavioral dissociations. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) of 73 left hemisphere stroke survivors (male and female human subjects) not preselected for stereotyped dissociations revealed the differential contributions of specific cortical regions to reading pseudowords (ventral precentral gyrus), regular words (planum temporale, supramarginal gyrus, ventral precentral and postcentral gyrus, and insula), and concrete words (pars orbitalis and pars triangularis). Consistent with the primary systems view of reading being parasitic on language-general circuitry, our multivariate LSM analyses revealed that phonological decoding depends on perisylvian areas subserving sound-motor integration and that semantic effects on reading depend on frontal cortex subserving control over concrete semantic representations that aid phonological access from print. As the first study to localize the differential cortical contributions to reading pseudowords, regular words, and concrete words in stroke survivors with variable reading abilities, our results provide important information on the neurobiological basis of reading and highlight the insights attainable through multivariate, process-based approaches to alexia.',\n",

Here, we report that lysosomal dysfunction in Down ayndrome (trisomy 21), a neurodevelopmental disorder and form of early onset AD, requires the extra gene copy of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is specifically mediated by the β cleaved carboxy terminal fragment of APP (APP-βCTF, C99). In primary fibroblasts from individuals with DS, lysosomal degradation of autophagic and endocytic substrates is selectively impaired, causing them to accumulate in enlarged autolysosomes/lysosomes. Direct measurements of lysosomal pH uncovered a significant elevation (0.6 units) as a basis for slowed LC3 turnover and the inactivation of cathepsin D and other lysosomal hydrolases known to be unstable or less active when lysosomal pH is persistently elevated. Normalizing lysosome pH by delivering acidic nanoparticles to lysosomes ameliorated lysosomal deficits, whereas RNA sequencing analysis excluded a transcriptional contribution to hydrolase declines.

       " \"Spaced learning has been shown consistently to benefit memory compared with massed learning, yet the neural representations and processes underlying the spacing effect are still poorly understood. In particular, two influential models (i.e., the encoding variability hypothesis and the study-phase retrieval hypothesis) could both model behavioral performance very well, but they make opposite hypotheses regarding the spacing effect's neural mechanisms. The present study attempted to provide empirical neural evidence to adjudicate these competing hypotheses. Using spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) analysis of EEG data, this study investigated whether and how repetition lags (massed/short-spaced/long-spaced) modulated the STPS's contribution to episodic memory encoding in male and female human participants. The results revealed that greater item-specific STPS in the right frontal electrodes at 543-727 ms after stimulus onset was associated with better memory performance. More importantly, this STPS was larger under the spaced-learning condition than the massed-learning condition and partially mediated the spacing effect on memory performance. In addition, we found that massed learning was associated with stronger repetition suppression in the N400 component that reflected momentary retrieval strength, but reduced activity in the late positive component that was associated with memory retrieval. These results suggest that spaced learning improves long-term memory by increasing retrieval effort and enhancing the pattern reinstatement of prior neural representations, which may be achieved by reducing the momentary retrieval strength as the extended repetition lags might help to eliminate the residual representation in working memory.\",\n",
       " 'Our ability to recognize others by their facial features is at the core of human social interaction, yet this ability varies widely within the general population, ranging from developmental prosopagnosia to \"super-recognizers\". Previous work has focused mainly on the contribution of neural activity within the well described face network to this variance. However, given the nature of face memory in everyday life, and the social context in which it takes place, we were interested in exploring how the collaboration between different networks outside the face network in humans (measured through resting state connectivity) affects face memory performance. Fifty participants (men and women) were scanned with fMRI. Our data revealed that although the nodes of the face-processing network were tightly coupled at rest, the strength of these connections did not predict face memory performance. Instead, face recognition memory was dependent on multiple connections between these face patches and regions of the medial temporal lobe memory system (including the hippocampus), and the social processing system. Moreover, this network was selective for memory for faces, and did not predict memory for other visual objects (cars). These findings suggest that in the general population, variability in face memory is dependent on how well the face processing system interacts with other processing networks, with interaction among the face patches themselves accounting for little of the variance in memory ability.',\n",
       " 'Synucleinopathies are characterized by the accumulation of insoluble α-synuclein (αSyn). To test whether αSyn aggregates modulate synaptic activity, we used a recently developed model in primary neurons for inducing αSyn pathology. We demonstrated that preformed fibrils (PFFs) generated with recombinant human αSyn compromised synaptic activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner and that the magnitude of these deficits correlated with the formation of αSyn pathology in cultured excitatory hippocampal neurons from both sexes of mice. Remarkably, acute passive infusion of αSyn PFFs from whole-cell patch-clamp pipette decreased mEPSC frequency within 10 min followed by induction of αSyn pathology within 1 d. Moreover, by direct addition of αSyn PFFs into culture medium, the formation of misfolded αSyn inclusions dramatically compromised the colocalization of synaptic markers and altered dynamic changes of dendritic spines, but the viability of neurons was not affected up to 7 d post-treatment with αSyn PFFs. Our data indicate that intraneuronal αSyn fibrils impaired the initiation of synaptogenesis and their physiological functions, thereby suggesting that targeting synaptic dysfunction in synucleinopathies may provide a promising therapeutic direction.',\n",
       " 'The boundaries of the visual areas located anterior to V2 in the dorsomedial region of the macaque cortex remain contentious. This region is usually conceptualized as including two functional subdivisions: the dorsal component of area V3 (V3d) laterally and another area named the parietooccipital area (PO) or V6 medially. However, the nature of the putative border between V3d and PO/V6 has remained undefined. We recorded the receptive fields of multiunit clusters in male macaques and reconstructed the locations of recording sites using histological sections and computer-generated maps. Immediately adjacent to dorsomedial V2, we observed a representation of the lower contralateral quadrant that represented the vertical meridian at its rostral border. This region formed a simple eccentricity gradient from ∼<5° in the annectant gyrus to >60° in the parietooccipital medial sulcus. There was no topographic reversal where one would expect to find the border between V3d and PO/V6. Rather, near the midline, this lower quadrant map continued directly into a representation of the peripheral upper visual field without an intervening lower quadrant representation. Therefore, cortex previously assigned to the medial part of V3d and to PO/V6 forms a single map that includes parts of both quadrants. Together with previous observations that V3d and PO/V6 are densely myelinated relative to adjacent cortex and share similar input from V1, these results suggest that they are parts of a single area (for which we suggest the designation V6), which is distinct from the one forming the ventral component of the third-tier complex.',\n",
       " 'To make efficient foraging decisions, we must combine information about the values of available options with nonvalue information. Some accounts of ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) suggest that it has a narrow role limited to evaluating immediately available options. We examined responses of neurons in area 14 (a putative macaque homolog of human vmPFC) as 2 male macaques performed a novel foraging search task. Although many neurons encoded the values of immediately available offers, they also independently encoded several other variables that influence choice, but that are conceptually distinct from offer value. These variables include average reward rate, number of offers viewed per trial, previous offer values, previous outcome sizes, and the locations of the currently attended offer. We conclude that, rather than serving as specialized economic value center, vmPFC plays a broad role in integrating relevant environmental information to drive foraging decisions.',\n",

We combined current-clamp somatic and dendritic recordings, outside-out recordings of dendritic sodium and potassium currents, morphological reconstructions and multicompartment modeling on male and female rat SNc DA neurons to determine cell-to-cell variations in AIS and ABD geometry, and their influence on neuronal output (spontaneous pacemaking frequency, action potential [AP] shape). Both AIS and ABD geometries were found to be highly variable from neuron to neuron. Surprisingly, we found that AP shape and pacemaking frequency were independent of AIS geometry. Modeling realistic morphological and biophysical variations helped us clarify this result: in SNc DA neurons, the complexity of the ABD combined with its excitability predominantly define pacemaking frequency and AP shape, such that large variations in AIS geometry negligibly affect neuronal output and are tolerated.',\n",

More recently, indirect ways to regulate NMDA that would be less disruptive have been proposed and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) represents one such candidate. To characterize the cell populations involved, we demonstrated here that knock-out (KO) of mGluR5 in cholinergic, but not glutamatergic or parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic, neurons reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) and enhanced sensitivity to MK801-induced locomotor activity. Inhibition of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum by DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) resulted in reduced PPI further demonstrating the importance of these neurons in sensorimotor gating. Volume imaging and quantification were used to compare PV and cholinergic cell distribution, density, and total cell counts in the different cell-type-specific KO lines. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced NMDA receptor-mediated currents in cholinergic neurons of the medial septum in mGluR5 KO mice. These results obtained from male and female mice indicate that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell type involved in sensorimotor gating and are relevant to pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating such as schizophrenia.',\n",
       " 'The spatial and temporal regulation of calcium signaling in neuronal growth cones is essential for axon guidance. In growth cones, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a significant source of calcium signals. However, it is not clear whether the ER is remodeled during motile events to localize calcium signals in steering growth cones. The expression of the ER-calcium sensor, stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) is necessary for growth cone steering toward the calcium-dependent guidance cue BDNF, with STIM1 functioning to sustain calcium signals through store-operated calcium entry. However, STIM1 is also required for growth cone steering away from semaphorin-3a, a guidance cue that does not activate ER-calcium release, suggesting multiple functions of STIM1 within growth cones (Mitchell et al., 2012). STIM1 also interacts with microtubule plus-end binding proteins EB1/EB3 (Grigoriev et al., 2008). Here, we show that STIM1 associates with EB1/EB3 in growth cones and that STIM1 expression is critical for microtubule recruitment and subsequent ER remodeling to the motile side of steering growth cones.

       " 'Decisions we face in real life are inherently risky and can result in one of many possible outcomes. However, most of what we know about choice under risk is based on studies that use options with only two possible outcomes (simple gambles), so it remains unclear how the brain constructs reward values for more complex risky options faced in real life. To address this question, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to examine choice between pairs of simple gambles and pairs of three-outcome gambles in male and female human subjects. We found that subjects evaluated individual outcomes of three-outcome gambles by multiplying functions of reward magnitude and probability. To construct the overall value of each gamble, however, most subjects differentially weighted possible outcomes based on either reward magnitude or probability. These results reveal a novel dissociation between how reward information is processed when evaluating complex gambles: valuation of each outcome is based on a combination of reward information whereas weighting of possible outcomes mainly relies on a single piece of reward information. We show that differential weighting of possible outcomes could enable subjects to make decisions more easily and quickly. Together, our findings reveal a plausible mechanism for how salience, in terms of possible reward magnitude or probability, can influence the construction of subjective values for complex gambles. They also point to separable neural mechanisms for how reward value controls choice and attention to allow for more adaptive decision making under risk.',\n",

       " 'Movement vigor, defined as the reciprocal of the latency from availability of reward to its acquisition, changes with reward magnitude: movements exhibit shorter reaction time and increased velocity when they are directed toward more rewarding stimuli. This invigoration may be due to release of dopamine before movement onset, which has been shown to be modulated by events that signal reward prediction error (RPE). Here, we generated an RPE event in the milliseconds before movement onset and tested whether there was a relationship between RPE and vigor. Human subjects (both sexes) made saccades toward an image. During execution of the primary saccade, we probabilistically changed the position and content of that image, encouraging a secondary saccade. On some trials, the content of the secondary image was more valuable than the first image, resulting in a positive RPE (+RPE) event that preceded the secondary saccade. On other trials, this content was less valuable (-RPE event). We found that reaction time of the secondary saccade was affected in an orderly fashion by the magnitude and direction of the preceding RPE event: the most vigorous saccades followed the largest +RPE, whereas the least vigorous saccades followed the largest -RPE. Presence of the secondary saccade indicated that the primary saccade had experienced a movement error, inducing trial-to-trial adaptation. However, this learning from movement error was not modulated by the RPE event. The data suggest that RPE events, which are thought to transiently alter the release of dopamine, modulate the vigor of the ensuing movement.',\n",

Hippocampal place cells encode the position of an animal in space by firing when the subject is at a specific location in the environment. Therefore, place cells are considered essential to spatial memory and navigation. It has recently been revealed that place-cell activity is not constant even in a familiar environment, but changes dynamically over time. However, the mechanism behind these changes in activity is not yet fully understood. In this study, the activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons of male mice was tracked during repeated performances of a spatial task in a virtual reality environment. By comparing place-cell ensemble representations among repeated performance of the task, the overlap rate of the active place-cell population was found to be time dependent but independent of the number of tasks within a fixed time. These findings suggest that place codes change automatically and at a constant speed. Furthermore, the dynamics of place-cell activity were found to be suppressed by an NMDA receptor antagonist. In summary, the spontaneously dynamic nature of place-cell activity is at least in part regulated by NMDA receptors, and the dynamics may encode temporal information of episodes.',\n",

These individual differences in music reward sensitivity are driven by variability in functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a key structure of the reward system, and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, it is unknown whether a neuroanatomical basis exists for this variability. We used diffusion tensor imaging and probabilistic tractography to study the relationship between music reward sensitivity and white matter microstructure connecting these two regions via the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in 38 healthy human participants (24 females and 14 males). We found that right axial diffusivity (AD) in the STG-OFC connectivity inversely correlated with music reward sensitivity. Additionally, right mean diffusivity and left AD in the NAcc-OFC tract also showed an inverse correlation. Further, AD in this tract also correlated with previously acquired BOLD activity during music listening, but not for a control monetary reward task in the NAcc. Finally, we used mediation analysis to show that AD in the NAcc-OFC tract explains the influence of NAcc activation during a music task on music reward sensitivity. Overall, our results provide further support for the idea that the exchange of information among perceptual, integrative, and reward systems is important for musical pleasure, and that individual differences in the structure of the relevant anatomical connectivity influences the degree to which people are able to derive such pleasure.',\n",
       " \"Social signals play powerful roles in shaping self-oriented reward valuation and decision making. These signals activate social and valuation/decision areas, but the core computation for their integration into the self-oriented decision machinery remains unclear. Here, we study how a fundamental social signal, social value (others' reward value), is converted into self-oriented decision making in the human brain. Using behavioral analysis, modeling, and neuroimaging, we show three-stage processing of social value conversion from the offer to the effective value and then to the final decision value. First, a value of others' bonus on offer, called offered value, was encoded uniquely in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) and also in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ldlPFC), which is commonly activated by offered self-bonus value. The effective value, an intermediate value representing the effective influence of the offer on the decision, was represented in the right anterior insula (rAI), and the final decision value was encoded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Second, using psychophysiological interaction and dynamic causal modeling analyses, we demonstrated three-stage feedforward processing from the rTPJ and ldPFC to the rAI and then from rAI to the mPFC. Further, we showed that these characteristics of social conversion underlie distinct sociobehavioral phenotypes. We demonstrate that the variability in the conversion underlies the difference between prosocial and selfish subjects, as seen from the differential strength of the rAI and ldlPFC coupling to the mPFC responses, respectively.

We also found that OVX-associated reduction of spine density in somatosensory cortex was accompanied by a reduction in miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency (but not mIPSC frequency), indicating a change in functional synapses. OVX-associated spine loss in somatosensory cortex was also rescued by an agonist of the G-protein-linked estrogen receptor (GPER) but not by agonists of the classic estrogen receptors ERα/ERβ, whereas the opposite selectivity was found in area CA1. Acute treatment of neocortical slices with E2 also rescued the OVX-associated reduction in mEPSC frequency, which could be mimicked by a GPER agonist and abolished by a GPER antagonist.

Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream affect. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is considered a marker of affective states and traits as well as affect regulation in the waking state. Here, we explored whether FAA during REM sleep and during evening resting wakefulness is related to affective experiences in REM sleep dreams. EEG recordings were obtained from 17 human participants (7 men) who spent 2 nights in the sleep laboratory. Participants were awakened 5 min after the onset of every REM stage after which they provided a dream report and rated their dream affect. Two-minute preawakening EEG segments were analyzed. Additionally, 8 min of evening presleep and morning postsleep EEG were recorded during resting wakefulness. Mean spectral power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and corresponding FAA were calculated over the frontal (F4-F3) sites. Results showed that FAA during REM sleep, and during evening resting wakefulness, predicted ratings of dream anger. This suggests that individuals with greater alpha power in the right frontal hemisphere may be less able to regulate (i.e., inhibit) strong affective states, such as anger, in dreams. Additionally, FAA was positively correlated across wakefulness and REM sleep. Together, these findings imply that FAA may serve as a neural correlate of affect regulation not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.',\n",

       " 'Neuronal circuits often display small-world network architecture characterized by neuronal cliques of dense local connectivity communicating with each other through a limited number of cells that participate in multiple cliques. The principles by which such cliques organize to encode information remain poorly understood. Similarly tuned pyramidal cells that preferentially target each other may form multicellular encoding units performing distinct computational tasks. The existence of such units can reflect upon both spontaneous and stimulus-driven population events.We applied two-photon calcium imaging to study spontaneous population bursts in layer 2/3 of area V1 in male C57BL/6 mice. To identify potential small-world cliques, we searched for pyramidal cells whose calcium events had a consistent temporal relationship with the events of local inhibitory interneurons. This was guided by the intuition that groups of neurons whose synchronous firing represents a temporally coherent computational unit should be inhibited together. Pyramidal members of these interneuron-centered clusters on average displayed stronger functional connectivity between each other than with nonmember pyramidal neurons. The structure of the clusters evolved during postnatal development: cluster size and overlap between clusters decreased with developmental maturation. Pyramidal neurons in a cluster showed higher than chance tuning function similarity between each other and with the linked interneuron. Thus, spontaneous population events in V1 are shaped by small-world subnetworks of pyramidal neurons that share functional properties and work as a coherent unit with a local interneuron. These interneuron-pyramidal cell partnerships may represent a fundamental neocortical unit of computation at the population level.',\n",
       " 'Absence epilepsy is a heritable human neurological disorder characterized by brief nonconvulsive seizures with behavioral arrest, moderate-to-severe loss of consciousness (absence), and distinct spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the EEG and electrocorticogram (ECoG). Genetic models of this disorder have been created by selectively inbreeding rats for absence seizure-like events with similar electrical and behavioral characteristics. However, these events are also common in outbred laboratory rats, raising concerns about whether SWD/immobility accurately reflects absence epilepsy as opposed to \"normal\" rodent behavior. We hypothesized that, if SWD/immobility models absence seizures, it would not exist in wild-caught rats due to the pressures of natural selection. To test this hypothesis, we compared chronic video/electrocorticogram recordings from male and female wild-caught (Brown-Norway [BN]) rats to recordings from laboratory outbred BN, outbred Long-Evans, and inbred WAG/Rij rats (i.e., a model of absence epilepsy). Wild-caught BN rats displayed absence-like SWD/immobility events that were highly similar to outbred BN rats in terms of spike-wave morphology, frequency, diurnal rhythmicity, associated immobility, and sensitivity to the anti-absence drug, ethosuximide; however, SWD bursts were less frequent and of shorter duration in wild-caught and outbred BN rats than the outbred Long-Evans and inbred WAG/Rij strains. We conclude that SWD/immobility in rats does not represent absence seizures, although they appear to have many similarities. In wild rats, SWD/immobility appears to represent normal brain activity that does not reduce survival in natural environments, a conclusion that logically extends to outbred laboratory rats and possibly to those that have been inbred to model absence epilepsy.',\n",

The axon initial segment (AIS) separates the axon from the somatodendritic compartment and controls the microtubule-dependent transport into the axon. Interestingly, the AIS has a characteristic microtubule organization; it contains bundles of closely spaced microtubules with electron dense cross-bridges, referred to as microtubule fascicles. The microtubule binding protein TRIM46 localizes to the AIS and when overexpressed in non-neuronal cells forms microtubule arrays that closely resemble AIS fascicles in neurons. However, the precise role of TRIM46 in microtubule fasciculation in neurons has not been studied. Here we developed a novel correlative light and electron microscopy approach to study AIS microtubule organization. We show that in cultured rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes, TRIM46 levels steadily increase at the AIS during early neuronal differentiation and at the same time closely spaced microtubules form, whereas the fasciculated microtubules appear at later developmental stages. Moreover, we localized TRIM46 to the electron dense cross-bridges and show that depletion of TRIM46 causes loss of cross-bridges and increased microtubule spacing. These data indicate that TRIM46 has an essential role in organizing microtubule fascicles in the AIS.',\n",

It is also three times more common in women; reasons for this sex difference are not known. Using preclinical behavioral models of migraine, we show that application of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to the rat dura mater produces cutaneous periorbital hypersensitivity. Surprisingly, this response was observed only in females; dural CGRP at doses from 1 pg to 3.8 μg produce no responses in males. In females, dural CGRP causes priming to a pH 7.0 solution after animals recover from the initial CGRP-induced allodynia. Dural application of interleukin-6 causes acute responses in males and females but only causes priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Intracisternal application of BDNF also causes similar acute hypersensitivity responses in males and females but only priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Females were additionally primed to a subthreshold dose of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (0.1 mg/kg) following dural CGRP. Finally, the sexually dimorphic responses to dural CGRP were not specific to rats as similar female-specific hypersensitivity responses were seen in mice, where increased grimace responses were also observed. These data are the first to demonstrate that CGRP-induced headache-like behavioral responses at doses up to 3.8 μg are female-specific both acutely and following central and peripheral priming. These data further implicate dural CGRP signaling in the pathophysiology of migraine and propose a model where dural CGRP-based mechanisms contribute to the sexual disparity of this female-biased disorder.',\n",

To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms orchestrating this spontaneous rewiring. In this study, we provide insights into the molecular changes in the spinal cord tissue after large ischemic cortical injury in adult female mice, with a focus on factors that might influence the reinnervation process by contralesional corticospinal neurons. We mapped the area of cervical gray matter reinnervation by sprouting contralesional corticospinal axons after unilateral photothrombotic stroke of the motor cortex in mice using anterograde tracing. The mRNA profile of this reinnervation area was analyzed using whole-genome sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes at selected time points during the recovery process. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two phases of processes: early after stroke (4-7 d post-injury), the spinal transcriptome is characterized by inflammatory processes, including phagocytic processes as well as complement cascade activation. Microglia are specifically activated in the denervated corticospinal projection fields in this early phase. In a later phase (28-42 d post-injury), biological processes include tissue repair pathways with upregulated genes related to neurite outgrowth. Thus, the stroke-denervated spinal gray matter, in particular its intermediate laminae, represents a growth-promoting environment for sprouting corticospinal fibers originating from the contralesional motor cortex. This dataset provides a solid starting point for future studies addressing key elements of the post-stroke recovery process, with the goal to improve neuroregenerative treatment options for stroke patients.',\n",
       " 'Neuroimaging investigations have revealed interindividual variations in anatomy, metabolism, activity, and connectivity of specific cortical association areas through which years of education (YoE), as a common proxy of cognitive reserve, may operate in the face of age- or pathology-associated brain changes. However, the associated molecular properties of YoE-related brain regions and the biological pathways involved remain poorly understood. In the present study we first identified brain areas that showed an association between cortical thickness and YoE among 122 cognitively healthy older human individuals (87 female). We subsequently characterized molecular properties of these regions by studying brain-wide microarray measurements of regional gene expression. In accordance with previous studies, we observed that YoE were associated with higher cortical thickness in medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas. Compared with the rest of the cortex, these regions exhibited a distinct gene expression profile characterized by relative upregulation of gene sets implicated in ionotropic and metabotropic neurotransmission as well as activation of immune response. Our genome-wide expression profile analysis of YoE-related brain regions points to distinct molecular pathways that may underlie a higher capacity for plastic changes in response to lifetime intellectual enrichment and potentially also a higher resilience to age-related pathologic brain changes.',\n",

These glutamatergic inputs to striatal GABAergic interneurons have been suggested to regulate the spike timing of striatal projection neurons via feedforward inhibition. Understanding how different excitatory inputs are integrated within the striatal circuitry and how they regulate striatal output is crucial for understanding basal ganglia function and related behaviors. Here, using VGLUT2 mice from both sexes, we report the existence of a glutamatergic projection from the mesencephalic locomotor region to the striatum that avoids the spiny neurons and selectively innervates interneurons. Specifically, optogenetic activation of glutamatergic axons from the pedunculopontine nucleus induced monosynaptic excitation in most recorded striatal cholinergic interneurons and GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Optogenetic stimulation in awake head-fixed mice consistently induced an increase in the firing rate of putative cholinergic interneurons and fast-spiking interneurons.

Although computational models indicate that reorganization of recurrent connectivity is a primary driver of experience-dependent cortical tuning, the true biological features of recurrent network plasticity are not well identified. Indeed, whether rewiring of connections between cortical neurons occurs during behavioral training, as is widely predicted, remains unknown. Here, we probe M1 recurrent circuits following motor training in adult male rats and find robust synaptic reorganization among functionally related layer 5 neurons, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in recurrent connection probability. This reorganization is specific to the neuronal subpopulation most relevant for executing the trained motor skill, and behavioral performance was impaired following targeted molecular inhibition of this subpopulation. In contrast, recurrent connectivity is unaffected among neighboring layer 5 neurons largely unrelated to the trained behavior. Training-related corticospinal cells also express increased excitability following training.

Among neurons tuned to both attributes, tuning for shape and texture were largely separable, with the latter delayed by ∼30 ms. We also found that shape stimuli typically evoked stronger, more selective responses than did texture patches, regardless of whether the latter were contained within or extended beyond the receptive field.

We then decreased the likelihood of reinforcement for trained mice, requiring them to modify action-outcome expectations. In a separate experiment, we blocked action-outcome updating via chemogenetic inactivation of the OFC.

       " 'Excitatory synapses onto somatostatin (SOM) interneurons show robust short-term facilitation. This hallmark feature of SOM interneurons arises from a low initial release probability that regulates the recruitment of interneurons in response to trains of action potentials. Previous work has shown that Elfn1 (extracellular leucine rich repeat and fibronectin Type III domain containing 1) is necessary to generate facilitating synapses onto SOM neurons by recruitment of two separate presynaptic components: mGluR7 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 7) and GluK2-KARs (kainate receptors containing glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kainate 2). Here, we identify how a transsynaptic interaction between Elfn1 and mGluR7 constitutively reduces initial release probability onto mouse cortical SOM neurons. Elfn1 produces glutamate-independent activation of mGluR7 via presynaptic clustering, resulting in a divergence from the canonical \"autoreceptor\" role of Type III mGluRs, and substantially altering synaptic pharmacology. This structurally induced determination of initial release probability is present at both layer 2/3 and layer 5 synapses. In layer 2/3 SOM neurons, synaptic facilitation in response to spike trains is also dependent on presynaptic GluK2-KARs. In contrast, layer 5 SOM neurons do not exhibit presynaptic GluK2-KAR activity at baseline and show reduced facilitation. GluK2-KAR engagement at synapses onto layer 5 SOM neurons can be induced by calmodulin activation, suggesting that synaptic function can be dynamically regulated. Thus, synaptic facilitation onto SOM interneurons is mediated both by constitutive mGluR7 recruitment by Elfn1 and regulated GluK2-KAR recruitment, which determines the extent of interneuron recruitment in different cortical layers.',\n",
       " \"Interactions between the hippocampus (area CA1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are crucial for memory-guided behavior. Theta oscillations (∼8 Hz) underlie a key physiological mechanism for mediating these coordinated interactions, and theta oscillatory coherence and phase-locked spiking in the two regions have been shown to be important for spatial memory. Hippocampal place-cell activity associated with theta oscillations encodes spatial position during behavior, and theta phase-associated spiking is known to further mediate a temporal code for space within CA1 place fields. Although prefrontal neurons are prominently phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations in spatial memory tasks, whether and how theta oscillations mediate processing of spatial information across these networks remains unclear. Here, we addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of dorsal CA1-PFC ensembles and population decoding analyses in male rats performing a continuous spatial working memory task known to require hippocampal-prefrontal interactions. We found that in addition to CA1, population activity in PFC can also encode the animal's current spatial position on a theta-cycle timescale during memory-guided behavior. Coding of spatial position was coherent for CA1 and PFC ensembles, exhibiting correlated position representations within theta cycles. In addition, incorporating theta-phase information during decoding to account for theta-phase associated spiking resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of prefrontal spatial representations, similar to concurrent CA1 representations. These findings indicate a theta-oscillation-mediated mechanism of temporal coordination for shared processing and communication of spatial information across the two networks during spatial memory-guided behavior.\",\n",
       " 'During a critical period in development, spontaneous and evoked retinal activity shape visual pathways in an adaptive fashion. Interestingly, spontaneous activity is sufficient for spatial refinement of visual receptive fields (RFs) in superior colliculus (SC) and visual cortex (V1), but early visual experience is necessary to maintain inhibitory synapses and stabilize RFs in adulthood (Carrasco et al., 2005, 2011; Carrasco and Pallas, 2006; Balmer and Pallas, 2015a). In V1, BDNF and its high-affinity receptor TrkB are important for development of visual acuity, inhibition, and regulation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (Hanover et al., 1999; Huang et al., 1999; Gianfranceschi et al., 2003). To examine the generality of this signaling pathway for visual system plasticity, the present study examined the role of TrkB signaling during the critical period for RF refinement in SC. Activating TrkB receptors during the critical period (P33-P40) in dark reared subjects produced normally refined RFs, and blocking TrkB receptors in light-exposed animals resulted in enlarged adult RFs like those in dark reared animals. We also report here that deprivation- or TrkB blockade-induced RF enlargement in adulthood impaired fear responses to looming overhead stimuli and negatively impacted visual acuity. Thus, early TrkB activation is both necessary and sufficient to maintain visual RF refinement, robust looming responses, and visual acuity in adulthood. These findings suggest a common signaling pathway exists for the maturation of inhibition between V1 and SC.',\n",

The directional axes of the ON-DSGCs are thought to align with the axes of the vestibular system and provide sensitivity at rotational velocities that are too slow to activate the semicircular canals. ONOFF-DSGCs respond to faster image velocities. Using natural images that simulate the natural visual inputs to freely moving animals, we show that simulated visual saccades suppress responses in ON-DSGCs but not ONOFF-DSGCs recorded in retinas of domestic rabbits of either gender. Analysis of the synaptic inputs shows that this saccadic suppression results from glycinergic inputs that are specific to ON-DSGCs and are absent in ONOFF-DSGCs. When this glycinergic input is blocked, both cell types respond similarly to visual saccades and display essentially identical speed tuning. The results demonstrate that glycinergic circuits within the retina can produce saccadic suppression of retinal ganglion cell activity. The cell-type-specific targeting of the glycinergic circuits further supports the proposed physiological roles of ON-DSGCs in retinal-image stabilization and of ONOFF-DSGCs in detecting local object motion and signaling optical flow.',\n",

Highly rhythmic burst-firing parvalbumin-positive GABAergic medial septal neurons are strongly coupled to theta oscillations and target cortical GABAergic interneurons, contributing to coordination within one or several cortical regions. However, a large population of medial septal neurons of unidentified neurotransmitter phenotype and with unknown axonal target areas fire with a low degree of rhythmicity. We investigated whether low-rhythmic-firing neurons (LRNs) innervated similar or different cortical regions to high-rhythmic-firing neurons (HRNs) and assessed their temporal dynamics in awake male mice. The majority of LRNs were GABAergic and parvalbumin-immunonegative, some expressing calbindin; they innervated interneurons mostly in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. Individual LRNs showed several distinct firing patterns during immobility and locomotion, forming a parallel inhibitory stream for the modulation of cortical interneurons. Despite their fluctuating firing rates, the preferred firing phase of LRNs during theta oscillations matched the highest firing probability phase of principal cells in the DG and CA3. In addition, as a population, LRNs were markedly suppressed during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, had a low burst incidence, and several of them did not fire on all theta cycles. Therefore, CA3 receives GABAergic input from both HRNs and LRNs, but the DG receives mainly LRN input. We propose that distinct GABAergic LRNs contribute to changing the excitability of the DG and CA3 during memory discrimination via transient disinhibition of principal cells.',\n",

Here we use high-resolution two-photon microscopy in organotypic hippocampal slices from GAD65-GFP mice of both sexes to examine the signaling pathways induced by the postsynaptic signaling molecule Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) during inhibitory synapse formation. By monitoring changes in individual GFP-labeled presynaptic boutons, we found that the primary action of Sema4D is to induce stabilization of presynaptic boutons within tens of minutes. Stabilized boutons rapidly recruited synaptic vesicles, followed by accumulation of postsynaptic gephyrin and were functional after 24 h, as determined by electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. Inhibitory boutons are only sensitive to Sema4D at a specific stage during synapse formation and sensitivity to Sema4D is regulated by network activity. We further examined the intracellular signaling cascade triggered by Sema4D and found that bouton stabilization occurs through rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. This could be mimicked by the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin B or by reducing ROCK activity. We discovered that the intracellular signaling cascade requires activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, which is a well known autism risk factor. By using a viral approach to reduce MET levels specifically in inhibitory neurons, we found that their axons are no longer sensitive to Sema4D signaling. Together, our data yield important insights into the molecular pathway underlying activity-dependent Sema4D-induced synapse formation and reveal a novel role for presynaptic MET at inhibitory synapses.',\n",

Less is known about how the coordinated action of populations of neurons contribute to the initiation of eye movements. One cortical area of particular interest in this process is the frontal eye fields, a region of prefrontal cortex that has descending projections to oculomotor control centers. We recorded from populations of frontal eye field neurons in macaque monkeys engaged in a memory-guided saccade task. We found a variety of neurons with visually evoked responses, saccade-aligned responses, and mixtures of both. We took advantage of the simultaneous nature of the recordings to measure variability in individual neurons and pairs of neurons from trial-to-trial, as well as the moment-to-moment population activity structure. We found that these measures were related to saccadic reaction times, suggesting that the population-level organization of frontal eye field activity is important for the transition from perception to movement.',\n",
       " 'Electrocorticogram (ECoG), obtained by low-pass filtering the brain signal recorded from a macroelectrode placed on the cortex, is extensively used to find the seizure focus in drug-resistant epilepsy and is of growing importance in cognitive and brain-machine-interfacing studies. To accurately estimate the epileptogenic cortex or to make inferences about cognitive processes, it is important to determine the \"spatial spread\" of ECoG (i.e., the extent of cortical tissue that contributes to its activity). However, the ECoG spread is currently unknown; even the spread of local field potential (LFP) obtained from microelectrodes is debated, with estimates ranging from a few hundred micrometers to several millimeters. Spatial spread can be estimated by measuring the receptive field (RF) and multiplying by the cortical magnification factor, but this method overestimates the spread because RF size gets inflated due to several factors. This issue can be partially addressed using a model that compares the RFs of two measures, such as LFP and multi-unit activity (MUA). To use this approach for ECoG, we designed a customized array containing both microelectrodes and ECoG electrodes to simultaneously map MUA, LFP, and ECoG RFs from the primary visual cortex of awake monkeys (three female ',\n",

Here, we investigated the hemispheric distribution of alpha during orienting of attention in male and female right brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect. Temporal spectral evolution showed that in patients with neglect alpha oscillations over the damaged hemisphere were pathologically enhanced both during the baseline-fixation period that preceded cued orienting (capturing tonic alpha changes) and during orienting with leftward, rightward, or neutral-bilateral spatial cues (reflecting phasic alpha changes). Patients without neglect showed a similar though significantly less enhanced hemispheric asymmetry. Healthy control subjects displayed a conventional decrease of alpha activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the direction of orienting. In right-brain-damaged patients, neglect severity in the line bisection task was significantly correlated both with tonic alpha asymmetry during the baseline period and with phasic asymmetries during orienting of attention with neutral-bilateral and leftward cues. Asymmetries with neutral-bilateral and leftward cues were correlated with lesion of white matter tracts linking frontal with parietal-occipital areas. These findings show that disruption of rostrocaudal white matter connectivity in the right hemisphere interferes with the maintenance of optimal baseline tonic levels of alpha and the phasic modulation of alpha activity during shifts of attention. The hemispheric distribution of alpha activity can be used as a diagnostic tool for acquired pathological biases of spatial attention due to unilateral brain damage.',\n",

Here we investigated whether function-blocking antibodies against the nerve-fiber growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A applied to rats with severe SCI could prevent development of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Bladder function of rats with SCI was repeatedly assessed by urodynamic examination in fully awake animals. Four weeks after SCI, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia had developed in all untreated or control antibody-infused animals. In contrast, 2 weeks of intrathecal anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment led to significantly reduced aberrant maximum detrusor pressure during voiding and a reduction of the abnormal EMG high-frequency activity in the external urethral sphincter. Anatomically, we found higher densities of fibers originating from the pontine micturition center in the lumbosacral gray matter in the anti-Nogo-A antibody-treated animals, as well as a reduced number of inhibitory interneurons in lamina X. These results suggest that anti-Nogo-A therapy could also have positive effects on bladder function clinically.',\n",
       " 'Much evidence suggests that the angular gyrus (AnG) is involved in episodic memory, but its precise role has yet to be determined. We examined two possible accounts within the same experimental paradigm: the \"cortical binding of relational activity\" (CoBRA) account (Shimamura, 2011), which suggests that the AnG acts as a convergence zone that binds multimodal episodic features, and the subjectivity account (Yazar et al., 2012), which implicates AnG involvement in subjective mnemonic experience (such as vividness or confidence). fMRI was used during both encoding and retrieval of paired associates. During study, female and male human participants memorized picture-pairs of common objects (in the unimodal task) or of an object-picture and an environmental sound (in the crossmodal task). At test, they performed a cued-recall task and further indicated the vividness of their memory. During retrieval, BOLD activation in the AnG was greatest for vividly remembered associates, consistent with the subjectivity account. During encoding, the same effect of vividness was found, but this was further modulated by task: greater activations were associated with subsequent recall in the crossmodal than the unimodal task. Therefore, encoding data suggest an additional role to the AnG in crossmodal integration, consistent with its role at retrieval proposed by CoBRA. These results resolve some of the puzzles in the literature and indicate that the AnG can play different roles during encoding and retrieval as determined by the cognitive demands posed by different mnemonic tasks.',\n",

Everyday examples of an inability to exert such control over behavior are the overconsumption of food and drugs of abuse, which are important factors in the development of obesity and addiction, respectively. Here, we use a behavioral task that assesses the ability of male rats to exert behavioral restraint at the mere sight of palatable food during the presentation of an audiovisual threat cue to investigate the corticolimbic underpinnings of behavioral inhibition. We demonstrate a prominent role for the medial prefrontal cortex in the exertion of control over behavior under threat of punishment. Moreover, task engagement relies on function of the ventral striatum, whereas the basolateral amygdala mediates processing of the threat cue. Together, these data show that inhibition of reward pursuit requires the coordinated action of a network of corticolimbic structures.',\n",
       " 'Retrieval of long-term episodic memories is characterized by synchronized neural activity between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), with additional evidence that vmPFC activity leads that of the hippocampus. It has been proposed that the mental generation of scene imagery is a crucial component of episodic memory processing. If this is the case, then a comparable interaction between the two brain regions should exist during the construction of novel scene imagery. To address this question, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of MEG to investigate the construction of novel mental imagery. We tasked male and female humans with imagining scenes and single isolated objects in response to one-word cues. We performed source-level power, coherence, and causality analyses to characterize the underlying interregional interactions. Both scene and object imagination resulted in theta power changes in the anterior hippocampus. However, higher theta coherence was observed between the hippocampus and vmPFC in the scene compared with the object condition. This interregional theta coherence also predicted whether imagined scenes were subsequently remembered. Dynamic causal modeling of this interaction revealed that vmPFC drove activity in hippocampus during novel scene construction. Additionally, theta power changes in the vmPFC preceded those observed in the hippocampus. These results constitute the first evidence in humans that episodic memory retrieval and scene imagination rely on similar vmPFC-hippocampus neural dynamics. Furthermore, they provide support for theories emphasizing similarities between both cognitive processes and perspectives that propose the vmPFC guides the construction of context-relevant representations in the hippocampus.',\n",
       " 'Obesity and insulin resistance elicit blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in humans and animal models, but the relative contributions of the two pathologies remain poorly understood. These studies initially addressed the temporal progression of cerebrovascular dysfunction relative to dietary obesity or diet-induced insulin resistance in male mice. Obesity increased BBB permeability to the low molecular weight fluorophore sodium fluorescein (NaFl), whereas diet-induced insulin resistance increased permeability to both NaFl and Evans blue, which forms a high molecular weight complex with serum albumin. Serial section transmission electron microscopy analysis of hippocampal capillaries revealed that diabetes promotes involution of tight junctions, fenestration of endothelial cells, and pericyte regression. Chronic activation of adenosine receptor 2a (Adora2a) erodes tight junctions between endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature in other models of chronic neuropathology, and we observed that acute Adora2a antagonism normalized BBB permeability in wild-type mice with diet-induced insulin resistance. Experiments in mice with inducible deletion of Adora2a in endothelial cells revealed protection against BBB breakdown with diet-induced insulin resistance, despite comparable metabolic dysfunction relative to nontransgenic littermates. Protection against BBB breakdown was associated with decreased vascular inflammation, recovery of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and restoration of hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in vascular endothelial cells disrupts the BBB in dietary obesity, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the underlying mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and insulin resistance.',\n",
       " \"Detection of interaural time differences (ITDs) is crucial for sound localization in most vertebrates. The current view is that optimal computational strategies of ITD detection depend mainly on head size and available frequencies, although evolutionary history should also be taken into consideration. In archosaurs, which include birds and crocodiles, the brainstem nucleus laminaris (NL) developed into the critical structure for ITD detection. In birds, ITDs are mapped in an orderly array or place code, whereas in the mammalian medial superior olive, the analog of NL, maps are not found. As yet, in crocodilians, topographical representations have not been identified. However, nontopographic representations of ITD cannot be excluded due to different anatomical and ethological features of birds and crocodiles. Therefore, we measured ITD-dependent responses in the NL of anesthetized American alligators of either sex and identified the location of the recording sites by lesions made after recording. The measured extracellular field potentials, or neurophonics, were strongly ITD tuned, and their preferred ITDs correlated with the position in NL. As in birds, delay lines, which compensate for external time differences, formed maps of ITD. The broad distributions of best ITDs within narrow frequency bands were not consistent with an optimal coding model. We conclude that the available acoustic cues and the architecture of the acoustic system in early archosaurs led to a stable and similar organization in today's birds and crocodiles, although physical features, such as internally coupled ears, head size, or shape, and audible frequency range, vary among the two groups.\",\n",

The network formed by parietal and frontal areas lies at the core of cognitive-motor control because the outflow of parietofrontal signaling is conveyed to the subcortical centers and spinal cord through different parallel pathways, whose orchestration determines, not only when and how movements will be generated, but also the nature of forthcoming actions. Despite intensive studies over the last 50 years, the role of corticocortical connections in motor control and the principles whereby selected cortical networks are recruited by different task demands remain elusive. Furthermore, the synaptic integration of different cortical signals, their modulation by transthalamic loops, and the effects of conduction delays remain challenging questions that must be tackled to understand the dynamical aspects of parietofrontal operations. In this article, we evaluate results from nonhuman primate and selected rodent experiments to offer a viewpoint on how corticocortical systems contribute to learning and producing skilled actions. Addressing this subject is not only of scientific interest but also essential for interpreting the devastating consequences for motor control of lesions at different nodes of this integrated circuit. In humans, the study of corticocortical motor networks is currently based on MRI-related methods, such as resting-state connectivity and diffusion tract-tracing, which both need to be contrasted with histological studies in nonhuman primates.',\n",

Here we addressed whether mossy fiber inputs from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 principal cells are affected in an AD mouse model before amyloid β plaque deposition. We recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in a slice preparation from 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice, and studied synaptic properties and intrinsic excitability. In parallel we performed a morphometric analysis of mossy fiber synapses following viral based labeling and 3D-reconstruction. We found that the basal structural and functional properties as well as presynaptic short-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses are unaltered at 6 months in APP/PS1 mice. However, transient potentiation of synaptic transmission mediated by activity-dependent release of lipids was abolished. Whereas the presynaptic form of mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP) was not affected, the postsynaptic LTP of NMDAR-EPSCs was reduced. In addition, we also report an impairment in feedforward inhibition in CA3 pyramidal cells. This study, together with our previous work describing deficits at CA3-CA3 synapses, provides evidence that early AD affects synapses in a projection-dependent manner at the level of a single neuronal population.\",\n",

In the present study, we investigated the role of exogenous and endogenous PACAP in spine formation and maturation.

Notably, PACAP increased the levels of microRNA (miR)-132 and decreased expression of corresponding miR-132 target genes and protein expression of p250GAP, a miR-132 effector known to be involved in spine morphology regulation.

       " 'Recent psychophysical studies have demonstrated that periodic attention in the 4-8 Hz range facilitates performance on visual detection. The present study examined the periodicity of feature binding, another major function of attention, in human observers (3 females and 5 males for behavior, with 7 males added for the EEG experiment). In a psychophysical task, observers reported a synchronous pair of brightness (light/dark) and orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise) patterns from two combined brightness-orientation pairs presented in rapid succession. We found that temporal binding performance exhibits periodic oscillations at ∼8 Hz as a function of stimulus onset delay from a self-initiated button press in conditions where brightness-orientation pairs were spatially separated. However, as one would expect from previous studies on pre-attentive binding, significant oscillations were not apparent in conditions where brightness-orientation pairs were spatially superimposed. EEG results, while fully compatible with behavioral oscillations, also revealed a significant dependence of binding performance across trials on prestimulus neural oscillatory phases within the corresponding band. The peak frequency of this dependence was found to be correlated with intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) around the timing of button press in parietal sensors. Moreover, the peak frequency of the ITPC was found to predict behavioral frequency in individual observers. Together, these results suggest that attention operates periodically (at ∼8 Hz) on the perceptual binding of multimodal visual information and is mediated by neural oscillations phase-locked to voluntary action.',\n",
       " 'How does the brain link visual stimuli across space and time? Visual illusions provide an experimental paradigm to study these processes. When two stationary dots are flashed in close spatial and temporal succession, human observers experience a percept of apparent motion. Large spatiotemporal separation challenges the visual system to keep track of object identity along the apparent motion path, the so-called \"correspondence problem.\" Here, we use voltage-sensitive dye imaging in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys to show that intracortical connections within V1 can solve this issue by shaping cortical dynamics to represent the illusory motion. We find that the appearance of the second stimulus in V1 creates a systematic suppressive wave traveling toward the retinotopic representation of the first. Using a computational model, we show that the suppressive wave is the emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the intracortical network. This suppressive wave acts to explain away ambiguous correspondence problems and contributes to precisely encode the expected motion velocity at the surface of V1. Together, these results demonstrate that the nonlinear dynamics within retinotopic maps can shape cortical representations of illusory motion. Understanding these dynamics will shed light on how the brain links sensory stimuli across space and time, by preformatting population responses for a straightforward read-out by downstream areas.',\n",
       " 'Spike timing is an important factor in the modification of synaptic strength. Various forms of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) occur in the brains of diverse species, from insects to humans. In unimodal STDP, only LTP or LTD occurs at the synapse, regardless of which neuron spikes first; the magnitude of potentiation or depression increases as the time between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes decreases. This from of STDP may promote developmental strengthening or weakening of early projections. In bidirectional Hebbian STDP, the magnitude and the sign (potentiation or depression) of plasticity depend, respectively, on the timing and the order of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. In the rodent barrel cortex, multiple forms of STDP appear sequentially during development, and they contribute to network formation, retraction, or fine-scale functional reorganization. Hebbian STDP appears at L4-L2/3 synapses starting at postnatal day (P) 15; the synapses exhibit unimodal \"all-LTP STDP\" before that age. The appearance of Hebbian STDP at L4-L2/3 synapses coincides with the maturation of parvalbumin-containing GABA interneurons in L4, which contributes to the generation of L4-before-L2/3 spiking in response to thalamic input by producing fast feedforward suppression of both L4 and L2/3 cells. After P15, L4-L2/3 STDP mediates fine-scale circuit refinement, essential for the critical period in the barrel cortex. In this review, we first briefly describe the relevance of STDP to map plasticity in the barrel cortex, then look over roles of distinct forms of STDP during development. Finally, we propose a hypothesis that explains the transition from network formation to the initiation of the critical period in the barrel cortex.',\n",

In this work, we mated SPKO with 3xTg mice (3xTg/SPKO) to test the effect of SP deficiency in the AD mouse. We found that 6-month-old male 3xTg/SPKO mice restored normal spatial learning in the Barns maze, LTP in hippocampal slices, and expression levels of RyR in the hippocampus that were altered in the 3xTg mice. In addition, there was a marked reduction in 3xTg-associated phosphorylated tau, amyloid β plaques, and activated microglia in 3xTg/SPKO male and female mice.

       " 'Antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the medial habenula (MHb) or interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) triggers withdrawal-like behaviors in mice chronically exposed to nicotine, implying that nicotine dependence involves the sensitization of nicotinic signaling. Identification of receptor and/or neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this sensitization is important, as it could promote novel therapeutic strategies to reduce tobacco use. Using an approach involving photoactivatable nicotine, we previously demonstrated that chronic nicotine (cNIC) potently enhances nAChR function in dendrites of MHb neurons. However, whether cNIC modulates downstream components of the habenulo-interpeduncular (Hb-IP) circuit is unknown. In this study, cNIC-mediated changes to Hb-IP nAChR function were examined in mouse (male and female) brain slices using molecular, electrophysiological, and optical techniques. cNIC enhanced action potential firing and modified spike waveform characteristics in MHb neurons. Nicotine uncaging revealed nAChR functional enhancement by cNIC on proximal axonal membranes. Similarly, nAChR-driven glutamate release from MHb axons was enhanced by cNIC. In IPN, the target structure of MHb axons, neuronal morphology, and nAChR expression is complex, with stronger nAChR function in the rostral subnucleus [rostral IPN (IPR)]. As in MHb, cNIC induced strong upregulation of nAChR function in IPN neurons. This, coupled with cNIC-enhanced nicotine-stimulated glutamate release, was associated with stronger depolarization responses to brief (1 ms) nicotine uncaging adjacent to IPR neurons. Together, these results indicate that chronic exposure to nicotine dramatically alters nicotinic cholinergic signaling and cell excitability in Hb-IP circuits, a key pathway involved in nicotine dependence.',\n",

Many recent studies have consistently reported robust idiosyncratic visual sampling strategies during face recognition. Whether these interindividual differences are mirrored by idiosyncratic neural responses remains unknown. To this aim, we first tracked eye movements of male and female observers during face recognition. Additionally, for every observer we obtained an objective index of neural face discrimination through EEG that was recorded while they fixated different facial information. We found that foveation of facial features fixated longer during face recognition elicited stronger neural face discrimination responses across all observers. This relationship occurred independently of interindividual differences in preferential facial information sampling (e.g., eye vs mouth lookers), and started as early as the first fixation. Our data show that eye movements play a functional role during face processing by providing the neural system with the information that is diagnostic to a specific observer. The effective processing of identity involves idiosyncratic, rather than universal face representations.',\n",
       " \"Phase locking of auditory-nerve-fiber (ANF) responses to the fine structure of acoustic stimuli is a hallmark of the auditory system's temporal precision and is important for many aspects of hearing. Period histograms from phase-locked ANF responses to low-frequency tones exhibit spike-rate and temporal asymmetries, but otherwise retain an approximately sinusoidal shape as stimulus level increases, even beyond the level at which the mean spike rate saturates. This is intriguing because apical cochlear mechanical vibrations show little compression, and mechanoelectrical transduction in the receptor cells is thought to obey a static sigmoidal nonlinearity, which might be expected to produce peak clipping at moderate and high stimulus levels. Here we analyze phase-locked responses of ANFs from cats of both sexes. We show that the lack of peak clipping is due neither to ANF refractoriness nor to spike-rate adaptation on time scales longer than the stimulus period. We demonstrate that the relationship between instantaneous pressure and instantaneous rate is well described by an exponential function whose slope decreases with increasing stimulus level. Relatively stereotyped harmonic distortions in the input to the exponential can account for the temporal asymmetry of the period histograms, including peak splitting. We show that the model accounts for published membrane-potential waveforms when assuming a power-of-three, but not a power-of-one, relationship to exocytosis. Finally, we demonstrate the relationship between the exponential transfer functions and the sigmoidal pseudotransducer functions obtained in the literature by plotting the maxima and minima of the voltage responses against the maxima and minima of the stimuli.\",\n",

In rodents, V1 neurons exhibit a strong bias toward the contralateral eye. Molecular mechanisms of how OD is established and later maintained by plastic changes are largely unknown. Here we report a novel role of an activity-dependent immediate early gene Homer1a (H1a) in these processes. Using both sexes of H1a knock-out (KO) mice, we found that there is basal reduction in the OD index of V1 neurons measured using intrinsic signal imaging. This was because of a reduction in the strength of inputs from the contralateral eye, which is normally dominant in mice. The abnormal basal OD index was not dependent on visual experience and is driven by postnatal expression of H1a. Despite this, H1a KOs still exhibited normal shifts in OD index following a short-term (2-3 d) monocular deprivation (MD) of the contralateral eye with lid suture. However, unlike wild-type counterparts, H1a KOs continued to shift OD index with a longer duration (5-6 d) of MD. The same phenotype was recapitulated in a mouse model that has reduced Homer1 binding to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5).

At the physiological level, oligodendrocyte depolarization facilitates axonal conduction along myelinated fibers in the hippocampus; however, the functional significance of this facilitation is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the physiology of the facilitation of axonal conduction by investigating the changes in synaptic responses at destination synapses using male and female mice in which channelrhodopsin-2 expression was restricted to oligodendrocytes. The subiculum, one of the projection areas of the examined axons at the alveus of the hippocampus, is divided into three regions (proximal, mid, and distal) and contains two types of principal neurons: regular firing and bursting pyramidal cells. We found a significant increase in excitatory synaptic responses following optogenetic oligodendrocyte depolarization in bursting neurons at two of the three regions, but not in regular firing neurons at any region. The long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation at the synapses showing a significant increase was also enhanced after oligodendrocyte depolarization. Conversely, the reduction of oligodendrocyte depolarization during theta burst stimulation, which was achieved by photostimulation of archaerhodopsin-T expressed selectively on oligodendrocytes, reduced the magnitude of LTP. These results show that oligodendrocyte depolarization contributes to the fine control of synaptic activity between the axons they myelinate and targets subicular cells in a region- and cell type-specific manner, and suggest that oligodendrocyte depolarization during conditioning of stimuli is involved in the induction of LTP.',\n",

Pictures followed by a forget instruction elicited higher levels of processing in the ventral temporal cortex compared with those followed by a remember instruction.

Using high-speed imaging and machine vision, we estimated whisker-object mechanical forces at millisecond resolution. Mice solved the task by a sensory-motor strategy where both the strength and direction of whisker bending were informative cues to pole location. We found competing influences of immediate sensory input and choice memory on mouse choice. On correct trials, choice could be predicted from the direction and strength of whisker bending, but not from previous choice. In contrast, on error trials, choice could be predicted from previous choice but not from whisker bending. This study shows that animal choices during active tactile decision making can be predicted from mechanosensory and choice-memory signals, and provides a new task well suited for the future study of the neural basis of active perceptual decisions.',\n",

       " 'Cognitive control is necessary for goal-directed behavior, yet people treat cognitive control demand as a cost, which discounts the value of rewards in a similar manner as other costs, such as delay or risk. It is unclear, however, whether the subjective value (SV) of cognitive effort is encoded in the same putatively domain-general brain valuation network implicated in other cost domains, or instead engages a distinct frontoparietal network, as implied by recent studies. Here, we provide rigorous evidence that the valuation network, with core foci in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, also encodes SV during cognitive effort-based decision-making in healthy, male and female adult humans. We doubly dissociate this network from frontoparietal regions that are instead recruited as a function of decision difficulty. We show that the domain-general valuation network jointly and independently encodes both reward benefits and cognitive effort costs. We also demonstrate that cognitive effort SV signals predict choice and are influenced by state and trait motivation, including sensitivity to reward and anticipated task performance. These findings unify cognitive effort with other cost domains, and suggest candidate neural mechanisms underlying state and trait variation in willingness to expend cognitive effort.',\n",
       " 'Cognitive decision-making is known to be sensitive to the values of potential options, which are the probability and size of rewards associated with different choices. Here, we examine whether rapid motor responses to perturbations of visual feedback about movement, which mediate low-level and involuntary feedback control loops, reflect computations associated with high-level value-based decision-making. In three experiments involving human participants, we varied the value associated with different potential targets for reaching movements by controlling the distributions of rewards across the targets (Experiment 1), the probability with which each target could be specified (Experiment 2), or both (Experiment 3). We found that the size of rapid and involuntary feedback responses to movement perturbations was strongly influenced by the relative value between targets. A statistical model of relative value that includes a term for risk sensitivity provided the best fit to the visuomotor response data, illustrating that feedback control policies are biased to favor more frequent task success at the expense of the overall extrinsic reward accumulated through movement. Importantly however, the regulation of rapid feedback responses was associated with successful pursuit of high-value task outcomes. This implies that when we move, the brain specifies a set of feedback control gains that enable low-level motor areas not only to generate efficient and accurate movement, but also to rapidly and adaptively respond to evolving sensory information in a manner consistent with value-based decision-making.',\n",

Disruption of these events can cause long-term changes in cortical inhibition and may be involved in neurological disorders associated with inhibitory circuit dysfunction. We hypothesized that tonic glutamate signaling in the neonatal cortex contributes to, and is necessary for, the maturation of cortical interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we used mice of both sexes to quantify extracellular glutamate concentrations in the cortex during development, measure ambient glutamate-mediated activation of developing cortical interneurons, and manipulate tonic glutamate signaling using subtype-specific NMDA receptor antagonists ',\n",
       " 'The demands on a sensory system depend not only on the statistics of its inputs but also on the task. In olfactory navigation, for example, the task is to find the plume source; allocation of sensory resources may therefore be driven by aspects of the plume that are informative about source location, rather than concentration per se. Here we explore the implications of this idea for encoding odor concentration. To formalize the notion that sensory resources are limited, we considered coding strategies that partitioned the odor concentration range into a set of discriminable intervals. We developed a dynamic programming algorithm that, given the distribution of odor concentrations at several locations, determines the partitioning that conveys the most information about location. We applied this analysis to planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements of spatiotemporal odor fields with realistic advection speeds (5-20 cm/s), with or without a nearby boundary or obstacle. Across all environments, the optimal coding strategy allocated more resources (i.e., more and finer discriminable intervals) to the upper end of the concentration range than would be expected from histogram equalization, the optimal strategy if the goal were to reconstruct the plume, rather than to navigate. Finally, we show that ligand binding, as captured by the Hill equation, transforms odorant concentration into response levels in a way that approximates information maximization for navigation. This behavior occurs when the Hill dissociation constant is near the mean odor concentration, an adaptive set-point that has been observed in the olfactory system of flies.',\n",

However, direct evidence for such sequence replay is limited to only a few brain areas and sleep states mainly in rodents. Using a custom-designed wearable neural data logger and chronically implanted electrodes, we made long-term recordings of neural activity in the primary motor cortex of two female nonhuman primates during free behavior and natural sleep. We used the local field potential (LFP) spectrogram to characterize sleep cycles, and examined firing rates, correlations, and sequential firing of neurons at different frequency bands through the cycle. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) was characterized by low neural firing rates and high synchrony, reflecting slow oscillations between cortical down and up states. However, the order in which neurons entered up states was similar to the sequence of neural activity observed at low frequencies during waking behavior. In addition, we found evidence of brief bursts of theta oscillation, associated with non-SWS states, during which neurons fired in strikingly regular sequential order phase-locked to the LFP. Theta sequences were preserved between waking and sleep, but appeared not to resemble the order of neural activity observed at lower frequencies. The sequential firing of neurons during slow oscillations and theta bursts may contribute to the consolidation of procedural memories during sleep.',\n",

A critical aspect of this process is the integration of different images from the same face into a view-invariant representation that can be used for recognition. The representation of symmetrical viewpoints has been proposed to be a key computational step in achieving view-invariance. The aim of this study was to determine whether the representation of symmetrical viewpoints in face-selective regions is directly linked to the perception and recognition of face identity. In Experiment 1, we measured fMRI responses while male and female human participants viewed images of real faces from different viewpoints (-90, -45, 0, 45, and 90° from full-face view). Within the face regions, patterns of neural response to symmetrical views (-45 and 45° or -90 and 90°) were more similar than responses to nonsymmetrical views in the fusiform face area and superior temporal sulcus, but not in the occipital face area. In Experiment 2, participants made perceptual similarity judgements to pairs of face images. Images with symmetrical viewpoints were reported as being more similar than nonsymmetric views. In Experiment 3, we asked whether symmetrical views also convey an advantage when learning new faces. We found that recognition was best when participants were tested with novel face images that were symmetrical to the learning viewpoint. Critically, the pattern of perceptual similarity and recognition across different viewpoints predicted the pattern of neural response in face-selective regions. Together, our results provide support for the functional value of symmetry as an intermediate step in generating view-invariant representations.',\n",

However, very little is known about the link between cortical neural firing and cardiac-cycle duration (CCD). Here, we analyze single-unit and multiunit data obtained in humans at rest, and show that firing rate covaries with CCD in 16.7% of the sample (25 of 150). The link between firing rate and CCD was most prevalent in the anterior medial temporal lobe (entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, anterior hippocampus, and amygdala), where 36% (18 of 50) of the units show the effect, and to a lesser extent in the mid-to-anterior cingulate cortex (11.1%, 5 of 45). The variance in firing rate explained by CCD ranged from 0.5 to 11%. Several lines of analysis indicate that neural firing influences CCD, rather than the other way around, and that neural firing affects CCD through vagally mediated mechanisms in most cases. These results show that part of the spontaneous fluctuations in firing rate can be attributed to the cortical control of the cardiac cycle. The fine tuning of the regulation of CCD represents a novel physiological factor accounting for spontaneous variance in firing rate. It remains to be determined whether the \"noise\" introduced in firing rate by the regulation of CCD is detrimental or beneficial to the cognitive information processing carried out in the parahippocampal and cingulate regions.',\n",

Where and how the nervous system integrates expectations about reward with auditory sensory information to drive appropriate decisions is not fully understood. Using a two-alternative choice task in which the expected reward associated with each sound varied over time, we investigated potential sites along the corticostriatal pathway for the integration of sound signals, behavioral choice, and reward information in male mice. We found that auditory cortical neurons encode not only sound identity, but also the animal's choice and the expected size of reward. This influence of reward expectation on sound- and choice-related activity was further enhanced in the major striatal target of the auditory cortex: the posterior tail of the dorsal striatum. These results indicate that choice-specific information is integrated with reward signals throughout the corticostriatal pathway, potentially contributing to adaptation in sound-driven behavior.\",\n",

We here examined the interindividual variability in the vmPFC sulcal morphology in 57 humans (37 females) and demonstrated that the presence/absence of the inferior rostral sulcus and the subgenual intralimbic sulcus influences significantly the sulcal organization of this region. Furthermore, the sulcal organization influences the location of the vmPFC peak of the Default Mode Network, demonstrating that the location of functional activity can be affected by local sulcal patterns. These results are critical for the investigation of the function of the vmPFC and show that taking into account the sulcal variability might be essential to guide the interpretation of neuroimaging studies.',\n",
       " 'Values available for choice in different behavioral contexts can vary immensely. To compensate for this variability, neuronal circuits underlying economic decisions undergo adaptation. In orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), neurons encode the subjective value of offered and chosen goods in a quasilinear way. Previous experiments found that the gain of the encoding is lower when the value range is wider. However, the parameters OFC neurons adapted to remained unclear. Furthermore, previous studies did not examine additive changes in neuronal responses. Computational considerations indicate that these factors can directly impact choice behavior. Here we investigated how OFC neurons adapt to changes in the value range. We recorded from two male rhesus monkeys during a juice choice task. Each session was divided into two blocks of trials. In each block, juices were offered within a set range of values, and ranges changed between blocks. Across blocks, neuronal responses adapted to both the maximum and the minimum value, but only partially. As a result, the minimum neural activity was elevated in some value ranges relative to others. Through simulation of a linear decision model, we showed that increasing the minimum response increases choice variability, lowering the expected payoff. This effect is modulated by the balance between cells with positive and negative encoding. The presence of these two populations induces a non-monotonic relationship between the value range and choice efficacy, such that the expected payoff is highest for decisions in an intermediate value range.',\n",

       " 'Peripheral nerve injury results in persistent motor deficits, even after the nerve regenerates and muscles are reinnervated. This lack of functional recovery is partly explained by brain and spinal cord circuit alterations triggered by the injury, but the mechanisms are generally unknown. One example of this plasticity is the die-back in the spinal cord ventral horn of the projections of proprioceptive axons mediating the stretch reflex (Ia afferents). Consequently, Ia information about muscle length and dynamics is lost from ventral spinal circuits, degrading motor performance after nerve regeneration. Simultaneously, there is activation of microglia around the central projections of peripherally injured Ia afferents, suggesting a possible causal relationship between neuroinflammation and Ia axon removal. Therefore, we used mice (both sexes) that allow visualization of microglia (CX3CR1-GFP) and infiltrating peripheral myeloid cells (CCR2-RFP) and related changes in these cells to Ia synaptic losses (identified by VGLUT1 content) on retrogradely labeled motoneurons. Microgliosis around axotomized motoneurons starts and peaks within 2 weeks after nerve transection. Thereafter, this region becomes infiltrated by CCR2 cells, and VGLUT1 synapses are lost in parallel. Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and genetic lineage tracing showed that infiltrating CCR2 cells include T cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes, the latter differentiating into tissue macrophages. VGLUT1 synapses were rescued after attenuating the ventral microglial reaction by removal of colony stimulating factor 1 from motoneurons or in CCR2 global KOs. Thus, both activation of ventral microglia and a CCR2-dependent mechanism are necessary for removal of VGLUT1 synapses and alterations in Ia-circuit function following nerve injuries.',\n",

The temporal dynamics of sustained and transient neural activity supporting the selection and holding of memory content is not known. To address this problem, we recorded magnetoencephalography in healthy participants performing a retro-cue working memory task in which the selection rule and the memory content varied independently. Multivariate decoding and source analyses showed that selecting the memory content relies on prefrontal and parieto-occipital persistent oscillatory neural activity. By contrast, the memory content was reactivated in a distributed occipitotemporal posterior network, preceding the working memory decision and in a different format than during the visual encoding. These results identify a neural signature of content selection and characterize differentiated spatiotemporal constraints for subprocesses of working memory.',\n",
       " \"Sensory information is encoded by populations of cortical neurons. Yet, it is unknown how this information is used for even simple perceptual choices such as discriminating orientation. To determine the computation underlying this perceptual choice, we took advantage of the robust visual adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We first designed a stimulus paradigm in which we could vary the degree of neuronal adaptation measured in V1 during an orientation discrimination task. We then determined how adaptation affects task performance for mice of both sexes and tested which neuronal computations are most consistent with the behavioral results given the adapted population responses in V1. Despite increasing the reliability of the population representation of orientation among neurons, and improving the ability of a variety of optimal decoders to discriminate target from distractor orientations, adaptation increases animals' behavioral thresholds. Decoding the animals' choice from neuronal activity revealed that this unexpected effect on behavior could be explained by an overreliance of the perceptual choice circuit on target preferring neurons and a failure to appropriately discount the activity of neurons that prefer the distractor. Consistent with this all-positive computation, we find that animals' task performance is susceptible to subtle perturbations of distractor orientation and optogenetic suppression of neuronal activity in V1. This suggests that to solve this task the circuit has adopted a suboptimal and task-specific computation that discards important task-related information.\",\n",

In some cases, such as addictive drugs, aggression can be highly rewarding (appetitive) and continually pursued despite short- and long-term negative consequences. Similarly, recidivism (relapse) rates for repeat violent offenders are as high as relapse rates for drug addicts. Appetitive aggression and relapse to aggression seeking can be modeled in mice studies using conditioned place preference and self-administration procedures followed by a period of abstinence and subsequent tests for relapse to aggression preference and aggression seeking. These procedures allow for the study of the mechanisms that control the appetitive versus the consummatory (attack) phases of aggressive behavior. In this review, we first discuss the behavioral procedures developed to probe appetitive aggression in mouse models, spanning from Pavlovian to operant tasks, and we also describe the recently proposed phenomenon of \"aggression addiction.\" Next, we discuss the pharmacological and circuit mechanisms of aggression conditioned place preference and aggression self-administration, seeking, and relapse, highlighting mechanistic congruence and divergence between appetitive and consummatory phases of aggression.

First, we show that the population always changes its patterns of joint activity between the periods of sleep either side of a training session on the maze, regardless of successful rule learning during training. Next, by comparing the structure of population activity in sleep and training, we show that this population plasticity differs between learning and nonlearning sessions. In learning sessions, the changes in population activity in post-training sleep incorporate the changes to the population activity during training on the maze. In nonlearning sessions, the changes in sleep and training are unrelated. Finally, we show evidence that the nonlearning and learning forms of population plasticity are driven by different neuron-level changes, with the nonlearning form entirely accounted for by independent changes to the excitability of individual neurons, and the learning form also including changes to firing rate couplings between neurons. Collectively, our results suggest two different forms of population plasticity in mPFC during the learning of action-outcome relationships: one a persistent change in population activity structure decoupled from overt rule-learning, and the other a directional change driven by feedback during behavior.',\n",

However, perceptual body illusions - famously the rubber hand illusion (RHI) - can be elicited experimentally in healthy individuals. We hypothesize that the amygdala, a core component of neural circuits of threat processing, is involved in protective mechanisms against disturbed body perceptions. To test this hypothesis, we started by investigating two monozygotic human twin sisters with focal bilateral amygdala damage due to Urbach-Wiethe disease. Relative to 20 healthy women, the twins exhibited, on two occasions 1 year apart, augmented RHI responses in form of faster illusion onset and increased vividness ratings. Following up on these findings, we conducted a volumetric brain morphometry study involving an independent, gender-mixed sample of 57 healthy human volunteers (36 female, 21 male). Our results revealed a positive correlation between amygdala volume and RHI onset, i.e., the smaller the amygdala, the less time it took the RHI to emerge. This raised the question of whether a similar phenotype would result from experimental amygdala inhibition. To dampen amygdala reactivity, we intranasally administered the peptide hormone oxytocin to the same 57 individuals in a randomized trial before conducting the RHI. Compared with placebo, oxytocin treatment yielded enhanced RHI responses, again evident in accelerated illusion onset and increased vividness ratings.

       " 'Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to enhance learning and memory, yet the mechanisms behind these enhancements are unknown. Here, we present evidence that epigenetic modulation underlies VNS-induced improvements in cognition. We show that VNS enhances novelty preference (NP); alters the hippocampal, cortical, and blood epigenetic transcriptomes; and epigenetically modulates neuronal plasticity and stress-response signaling genes in male Sprague Dawley rats. Brain-behavior analysis revealed structure-specific relationships between NP test performance (NPTP) and epigenetic alterations. In the hippocampus, NPTP correlated with decreased histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11), a transcriptional repressor enriched in CA1 cells important for memory consolidation. In the cortex, the immediate early gene (IEG) ARC was increased in VNS rats and correlated with transcription of plasticity genes and epigenetic regulators, including HDAC3. For rats engaged in NPTP, ARC correlated with performance. Interestingly, blood ARC transcripts decreased in VNS rats performing NPTP, but increased in VNS-only rats. Because DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) facilitate transcription of IEGs, we investigated phosphorylated H2A.X (γH2A.X), a histone modification known to colocalize with DSBs. In agreement with reduced cortical stress-response transcription factor NF-κB1, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed reduced γH2A.X in the ARC promoter. Surprisingly, VNS did not significantly reduce transcription of cortical or hippocampal proinflammatory cytokines. However, TNFRSF11B (osteoprotegerin) correlated with NPTP as well as plasticity, stress-response signaling, and epigenetic regulation transcripts in both hippocampus and cortex.

       " 'The firing rate of speed cells, a dedicated subpopulation of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), is correlated with running speed. This correlation has been interpreted as a speed code used in various computational models for path integration. These models consider firing rate to be linearly tuned by running speed in real-time. However, estimation of firing rates requires integration of spiking events over time, setting constraints on the temporal accuracy of the proposed speed code. We therefore tested whether the proposed speed code by firing rate is accurate at short time scales using data obtained from open-field recordings in male rats and mice. We applied a novel filtering approach differentiating between speed codes at multiple time scales ranging from deciseconds to minutes. In addition, we determined the optimal integration time window for firing-rate estimation using a general likelihood framework and calculated the integration time window that maximizes the correlation between firing rate and running speed. Data show that these time windows are on the order of seconds, setting constraints on real-time speed coding by firing rate. We further show that optogenetic inhibition of either cholinergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca does not affect modulation of firing rates by running speed at each time scale tested.

       " 'Theoretical work predicts that decisions made with low confidence should lead to increased information-seeking. This is an adaptive strategy because it can increase the quality of a decision, and previous behavioral work has shown that decision-makers engage in such confidence-driven information-seeking. The present study aimed to characterize the neural markers that mediate the relationship between confidence and information-seeking. A paradigm was used in which 17 human participants (9 male) made an initial perceptual decision, and then decided whether or not they wanted to sample more evidence before committing to a final decision and confidence judgment. Predecisional and postdecisional event-related potential components were similarly modulated by the level of confidence and by information-seeking choices. Time-resolved multivariate decoding of scalp EEG signals first revealed that both information-seeking choices and decision confidence could be decoded from the time of the initial decision to the time of the subsequent information-seeking choice (within-condition decoding). No above-chance decoding was visible in the preresponse time window. Crucially, a classifier trained to decode high versus low confidence predicted information-seeking choices after the initial perceptual decision (across-condition decoding). This time window corresponds to that of a postdecisional neural marker of confidence.

Using RNA interference to partially deplete KIFC1 from rat neurons (from animals of either gender) in culture, pharmacologic agents that inhibit KIFC1, and expression of mutant KIFC1 constructs, we demonstrate critical roles for KIFC1 in regulating axonal growth and retraction as well as growth cone morphology. Experimental manipulations of KIFC1 elicit morphological changes in the axon as well as changes in the organization, distribution, and polarity orientation of its microtubules. Together, the results indicate a mechanism by which KIFC1 binds to microtubules in the axon and slides them into alignment in an ATP-dependent fashion and then cross-links them in an ATP-independent fashion to oppose their subsequent sliding by other motors.',\n",
       " 'Daily life often requires the coordination of our actions with those of another partner. After 50 years (1968-2018) of behavioral neurophysiology of motor control, the neural mechanisms that allow such coordination in primates are unknown. We studied this issue by recording cell activity simultaneously from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of two male interacting monkeys trained to coordinate their hand forces to achieve a common goal. We found a population of \"joint-action cells\" that discharged preferentially when monkeys cooperated in the task. This modulation was predictive in nature, because in most cells neural activity led in time the changes of the \"own\" and of the \"other\" behavior. These neurons encoded the joint-performance more accurately than \"canonical action-related cells\", activated by the action per se, regardless of the individual versus interactive context. A decoding of joint-action was obtained by combining the two brains\\' activities, using cells with directional properties distinguished from those associated to the \"solo\" behaviors. Action observation-related activity studied when one monkey observed the consequences of the partner\\'s behavior, i.e., the cursor\\'s motion on the screen, did not sharpen the accuracy of joint-action cells\\' representation, suggesting that it plays no major role in encoding joint-action. When monkeys performed with a non-interactive partner, such as a computer, joint-action cells\\' representation of the other (non-cooperative) behavior was significantly degraded. These findings provide evidence of how premotor neurons integrate the time-varying representation of the self-action with that of a co-actor, thus offering a neural substrate for successful visuomotor coordination between individuals.',\n",
       " 'Humans are particularly good at copying novel and meaningless gestures. The mechanistic and anatomical basis for this specialized imitation ability remains largely unknown. One idea is that imitation occurs by matching body configurations. Here we propose an alternative route to imitation that depends on a body-independent representation of the trajectory path of the end-effector. We studied a group of patients with strokes in the left frontoparietal cortices. We found that they were equally impaired at imitating movement trajectories using the ipsilesional limb (i.e., the nonparetic side) that were cued either by an actor using their whole arm or just by a cursor, suggesting that body configuration information is not always critical for imitation and that a representation of abstract trajectory shape may suffice. In addition, imitation ability was uncorrelated to the ability to identify the trajectory shape, suggesting that imitation deficits were unlikely to arise from perceptual impairments. Finally, a lesion-symptom mapping analysis found that imitation deficits were associated with lesions in left dorsal premotor but not parietal cortex. Together, these findings suggest a novel body-independent route to imitation that relies on the ability to plan abstract movement trajectories within dorsal premotor cortex.',\n",
       " 'Pitch and timbre are two primary features of auditory perception that are generally considered independent. However, an increase in pitch (produced by a change in fundamental frequency) can be confused with an increase in brightness (an attribute of timbre related to spectral centroid) and vice versa. Previous work indicates that pitch and timbre are processed in overlapping regions of the auditory cortex, but are separable to some extent via multivoxel pattern analysis. Here, we tested whether attention to one or other feature increases the spatial separation of their cortical representations and if attention can enhance the cortical representation of these features in the absence of any physical change in the stimulus. Ten human subjects (four female, six male) listened to pairs of tone triplets varying in pitch, timbre, or both and judged which tone triplet had the higher pitch or brighter timbre. Variations in each feature engaged common auditory regions with no clear distinctions at a univariate level. Attending to one did not improve the separability of the neural representations of pitch and timbre at the univariate level. At the multivariate level, the classifier performed above chance in distinguishing between conditions in which pitch or timbre was discriminated. The results confirm that the computations underlying pitch and timbre perception are subserved by strongly overlapping cortical regions, but reveal that attention to one or other feature leads to distinguishable activation patterns even in the absence of physical differences in the stimuli.',\n",
       " 'Neonatal hindpaw incision primes developing spinal nociceptive circuitry, resulting in enhanced hyperalgesia following reinjury in adulthood. Spinal microglia contribute to this persistent effect, and microglial inhibition at the time of adult reincision blocks the enhanced hyperalgesia. Here, we pharmacologically inhibited microglial function with systemic minocycline or intrathecal SB203580 at the time of neonatal incision and evaluated sex-dependent differences following adult reincision. Incision in adult male and female rats induced equivalent hyperalgesia and spinal dorsal horn expression of genes associated with microglial proliferation (',\n",
       " \"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder with characteristic motor features that arise due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra. Although symptomatic treatment by the dopamine precursor levodopa and dopamine agonists can improve motor symptoms, no disease-modifying therapy exists yet. Here, we show that Emapunil (AC-5216, XBD-173), a synthetic ligand of the translocator protein 18, ameliorates degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, preserves striatal dopamine metabolism, and prevents motor dysfunction in female mice treated with the MPTP, as a model of parkinsonism. We found that Emapunil modulates the inositol requiring kinase 1α (IRE α)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) unfolded protein response pathway and induces a shift from pro-inflammatory toward anti-inflammatory microglia activation. Previously, Emapunil was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and to be safe and well tolerated in a Phase II clinical trial. Therefore, our data suggest that Emapunil may be a promising approach in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\",\n",
